    "In this note, I apply the methodology of chemical reaction network theory in order to reproduce the Von Neumann-Sraffa uniform growth society profit-price relations and the Sraffa income distribution. Then, I generalize the Sraffa income distribution to account for taxation and corruption. Throughout, I identify how the chemical reaction network perspective might be used to differentiate between the structural and evolutionary constraints imposed on commodity abundance dynamics in a society, and how any questions of distribution must be considered in the context of those constraints."
