Born and raised in Buffalo, NY. Moved to Canada and got a degree in astrophyiscs from the University of Western Ontario - wrote an introduction to black hole thermodynamics for my senior thesis. Moved back to Buffalo and accidentally got a job teaching physics and engineering at Nardin Academy for a school year. Tutored SAT prep students for a year after that. Currently work as a knowledgebase engineer helping to match cancer patients to drug trials.

Published a book of poetry somewhere along the line. Hoping to finish writing down everything I can think of before I die. Doomed to fail.
