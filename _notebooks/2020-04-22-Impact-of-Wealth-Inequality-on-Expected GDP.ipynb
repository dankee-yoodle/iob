    "This note explores the effect of varying wealth inequality on expected GDP growth rate in a simplified economy, under the assumption that consumer behavior is motivated by the local distribution of available consumption opportunities. First, I introduce a theoretical framework for estimating expected GDP growth rate given a distribution of wealth and a distribution of available consumption opportunities. Second, I apply the framework to explore how expected GDP growth rate varies with wealth inequality and distribution of opportunity.\n",

    "Consider a simple economy with no taxes or subsidies, composed of M discrete units of wealth distributed among N economic agents. Taking the value-added perspective, the increase of the GDP of the economy over a time period $\\delta t$ - the GDP growth rate - can be written as the total wealth added through productive processes by the agents during the time period $\\delta t$.\n",

Assuming a constant, uniform return on investment $r$ such that  $p_{i} = (1+r)c_{i}$, the growth rate can be written as \n",

    "Assuming that the amount of wealth consumed by an economic agent during time period $\\delta t$ is a random variable with a probability distribution characterized by the agent's wealth, such that the expected amounts consumed by agents of identical wealth are identical; and that an economic agent can only consume as much wealth as it has, expected GDP growth rate can be written as\n",

    "Assuming that the probability an agent with wealth $w$ consumes an amount $c$ is the number of opportunities to consume amount $c$ relative to the total number of consumption opportunities available to an agent with wealth $w$, $P(c,w)$ can be written as\n",
