&lt;p&gt;AFTER an unequivocal experience of the inefficiency of the subsisting federal government, you are called upon to deliberate on a new Constitution for the United States of America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subject speaks its own importance; comprehending in its consequences nothing less than the existence of the UNION, the safety and welfare of the parts of which it is composed, the fate of an empire in many respects the most interesting in the world. It seems to have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy will it be if our choice should be directed by a judicious estimate of our true interests, unperplexed and unbiased by considerations not connected with the public good. But this is a thing more ardently to be wished than seriously to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the most formidable of the obstacles which the new Constitution will have to encounter may readily be distinguished the obvious interest of a certain class of men in every State to resist all changes which may hazard a diminution of the power, emolument, and consequence of the offices they hold under the State establishments; and the perverted ambition of another class of men, who will either hope to aggrandize themselves by the confusions of their country, or will flatter themselves with fairer prospects of elevation from the subdivision of the empire into several partial confederacies than from its union under one government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not, however, my design to dwell upon observations of this nature. I am well aware that it would be disingenuous to resolve indiscriminately the opposition of any set of men into interested or ambitious views. And a further reason for caution, in this respect, might be drawn from the reflection that in politics, as in religion, it is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword. Heresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, a torrent of angry and malignant passions will be let loose. To judge from the conduct of the opposite parties, we shall be led to conclude that an enlightened zeal for the energy and efficiency of government will be stigmatized as the offspring of a temper fond of despotic power and hostile to the principles of liberty. On the other hand, it will be equally forgotten that the vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty; that, in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed judgment, their interest can never be separated; and that a dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the people than under the forbidden appearance of zeal for the firmness and efficiency of government. History will teach us that the former has been found a much more certain road to the introduction of despotism than the latter, and that of those men who have overturned the liberties of republics, the greatest number have begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people; commencing demagogues, and ending tyrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the course of the preceding observations, I have had an eye, my fellow-citizens, to putting you upon your guard against all attempts to influence your decision by any impressions other than those which may result from the evidence of truth. You will no doubt have collected from the general scope of them, that they proceed from a source not unfriendly to the new Constitution. I am clearly of opinion it is your interest to adopt it. I shall not, however, multiply professions on this head. My motives must remain in the depository of my own breast. My arguments will be open to all, and may be judged of by all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose, in a series of papers, to discuss the following interesting particulars:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE UTILITY OF THE UNION TO YOUR POLITICAL PROSPERITY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION TO PRESERVE THAT UNION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE NECESSITY OF A GOVERNMENT AT LEAST EQUALLY ENERGETIC WITH THE ONE PROPOSED, TO THE ATTAINMENT OF THIS OBJECT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE CONFORMITY OF THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION TO THE TRUE PRINCIPLES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ITS ANALOGY TO YOUR OWN STATE CONSTITUTION and lastly,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE ADDITIONAL SECURITY WHICH ITS ADOPTION WILL AFFORD TO THE PRESERVATION OF THAT SPECIES OF GOVERNMENT, TO LIBERTY, AND TO PROPERTY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may perhaps be thought superfluous to offer arguments to prove the utility of the UNION, a point deeply engraved on the hearts of the great body of the people in every State. But the fact is, that we already hear it whispered in the private circles of those who oppose the new Constitution, that the thirteen States are of too great extent for any general system, and that we must of necessity resort to separate confederacies of distinct portions of the whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doctrine will, in all probability, be gradually propagated, till it has votaries enough to countenance an open avowal of it. It will therefore be of use to begin by examining the advantages of that Union, the certain evils, and the probable dangers, to which every State will be exposed from its dissolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of government, and it is equally undeniable, that whenever and however it is instituted, the people must cede to it some of their natural rights in order to vest it with requisite powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well worthy of consideration therefore, whether it would conduce more to the interest of the people of America that they should, to all general purposes, be one nation, under one federal government, or that they should divide themselves into separate confederacies, and give to the head of each the same kind of powers which they are advised to place in one national government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has until lately been a received and uncontradicted opinion that the prosperity of the people of America depended on their continuing firmly united. But politicians now appear, who insist that this opinion is erroneous, and that instead of looking for safety and happiness in union, we ought to seek it in a division of the States into distinct confederacies or sovereignties. However extraordinary this new doctrine may appear, it nevertheless has its advocates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has often given me pleasure to observe that a strong sense of the value and blessings of union induced the people, at a very early period, to institute a federal government to preserve and perpetuate it. They formed it almost as soon as they had a political existence; nay, at a time when their habitations were in flames, when many of their citizens were bleeding, and when the progress of hostility and desolation left little room for those calm and mature inquiries and reflections which must ever precede the formation of a wise and well-balanced government for a free people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not to be wondered at, that a government instituted in times so inauspicious, should on experiment be found greatly deficient and inadequate to the purpose it was intended to answer. This intelligent people perceived and regretted these defects. Still continuing no less attached to union than enamored of liberty, they as with one voice, convened the late convention at Philadelphia, to take that important subject under consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This convention composed of men who possessed the confidence of the people, in the mild season of peace, with minds unoccupied by other subjects, passed many months in cool, uninterrupted, and daily consultation; and finally, without having been awed by power, or influenced by any passions except love for their country, they presented and recommended to the people the plan produced by their joint and very unanimous councils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worthy of remark that not only the first, but every succeeding Congress, as well as the late convention, have invariably joined with the people in thinking that the prosperity of America depended on its Union. To preserve and perpetuate it was the great object of the people in forming that convention, and it is also the great object of the plan which the convention has advised them to adopt. With what propriety, therefore, or for what good purposes, are attempts at this particular period made by some men to depreciate the importance of the Union? Or why is it suggested that three or four confederacies would be better than one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am persuaded in my own mind that the people have always thought right on this subject, and that their universal and uniform attachment to the cause of the Union rests on great and weighty reasons, which I shall endeavor to develop and explain in some ensuing papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sincerely wish that it may be as clearly foreseen by every good citizen, that whenever the dissolution of the Union arrives, America will have reason to exclaim, in the words of the poet: &quot;FAREWELL! A LONG FAREWELL TO ALL MY GREATNESS&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IT IS not a new observation that the people of America have long and uniformly entertained of the importance of their continuing firmly united under one federal government, vested with sufficient powers for all general and national purposes. The more attentively I consider and investigate the reasons which appear to have given birth to this opinion, the more I become convinced that they are cogent and conclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the many objects to which a wise and free people find it necessary to direct their attention, that of providing for their SAFETY seems to be the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SAFETY of the people doubtless has relation to a great variety of circumstances and considerations, and consequently affords great latitude to those who wish to define it precisely and comprehensively. At present I mean only to consider it as it respects security for the preservation of peace and tranquillity, as well as against dangers from FOREIGN ARMS AND INFLUENCE, as from dangers of the LIKE KIND arising from domestic causes. As the former of these comes first in order, it is proper it should be the first discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us therefore proceed to examine whether the people are not right in their opinion that a cordial Union, under an efficient national government, affords them the best security that can be devised against HOSTILITIES from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of wars which have happened or will happen in the world will always be found to be in proportion to the number and weight of the causes, whether REAL or PRETENDED, which PROVOKE or INVITE them. If this remark be just, it becomes useful to inquire whether so many JUST causes of war are likely to be given by UNITED AMERICA as by DISUNITED America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JUST causes of war, for the most part, arise either from violation of treaties or from direct violence. America has already formed treaties with no less than six foreign nations. It is of high importance to the peace of America that she observe the laws of nations towards all these powers, and to me it appears evident that this will be more perfectly and punctually done by one national government than it could be either by thirteen separate States or by three or four distinct confederaciess. Because, under the national government, treaties and articles of treaties, as well as the laws of nations, will always be expounded in one sense and executed in the same manner,--whereas, adjudications on the same points and questions, in thirteen States, or in three or four confederacies, will not always accord or be consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, therefore, as either designed or accidental violations of treaties and the laws of nations afford JUST causes of war, they are less to be apprehended under one general government than under several lesser ones, and in that respect the former most favors the SAFETY of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to those just causes of war which proceed from direct and unlawful violence, it appears equally clear to me that one good national government affords vastly more security against dangers of that sort than can be derived from any other quarter. Because such violences are more frequently caused by the passions and interests of a part than of the whole; of one or two States than of the Union. Nothing can so effectually obviate that danger as a national government, whose wisdom and prudence will not be diminished by the passions which actuate the parties immediately interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not only fewer just causes of war will be given by the national government, but it will also be more in their power to accommodate and settle them amicably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will be more temperate and cool, and in that respect, as well as in others, will be more in capacity to act advisedly than the offending State. The pride of states, as well as of men, naturally disposes them to justify all their actions, and opposes their acknowledging, correcting, or repairing their errors and offenses. The national government, in such cases, will not be affected by this pride, but will proceed with moderation and candor to consider and decide on the means most proper to extricate them from the difficulties which threaten them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, it is well known that acknowledgments, explanations, and compensations are often accepted as satisfactory from a strong united nation, which would be rejected as unsatisfactory if offered by a State or confederacy of little consideration or power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the year 1685, the state of Genoa having offended Louis XIV., endeavored to appease him. He demanded that they should send their Doge, or chief magistrate, accompanied by four of their senators, to FRANCE. Would he on any occasion either have demanded or have received the like humiliation from Spain, or Britain, or any other POWERFUL nation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MY LAST paper assigned several reasons why the safety of the people would be best secured by union against the danger it may be exposed to by JUST causes of war given to other nations; and those reasons show that such causes would not only be more rarely given, but would also be more easily accommodated, by a national government than either by the State governments or the proposed little confederacies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the safety of the people of America against dangers from FOREIGN force depends not only on their forbearing to give JUST causes of war to other nations, but also on their placing and continuing themselves in such a situation as not to INVITE hostility or insult; for it need not be observed that there are PRETENDED as well as just causes of war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is too true, however disgraceful it may be to human nature, that nations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect of getting anything by it; nay, absolute monarchs will often make war when their nations are to get nothing by it, but for the purposes and objects merely personal, such as thirst for military glory, revenge for personal affronts, ambition, or private compacts to aggrandize or support their particular families or partisans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people of America are aware that inducements to war may arise out of these circumstances, as well as from others not so obvious at present. Wisely, therefore, do they consider union and a good national government as necessary to put and keep them in SUCH A SITUATION as, instead of INVITING war, will tend to repress and discourage it. That situation consists in the best possible state of defense, and necessarily depends on the government, the arms, and the resources of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the safety of the whole is the interest of the whole, and cannot be provided for without government, either one or more or many, let us inquire whether one good government is not, relative to the object in question, more competent than any other given number whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One government can collect and avail itself of the talents and experience of the ablest men, in whatever part of the Union they may be found. It can move on uniform principles of policy. It can harmonize, assimilate, and protect the several parts and members, and extend the benefit of its foresight and precautions to each. It can apply the resources and power of the whole to the defense of any particular part, and that more easily and expeditiously than State governments or separate confederacies can possibly do, for want of concert and unity of system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can place the militia under one plan of discipline, and, by putting their officers in a proper line of subordination to the Chief Magistrate, will, as it were, consolidate them into one corps, and thereby render them more efficient than if divided into thirteen or into three or four distinct independent companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would the militia of Britain be if the English militia obeyed the government of England, if the Scotch militia obeyed the government of Scotland, and if the Welsh militia obeyed the government of Wales? If one national government, had not so regulated the navigation of Britain as to make it a nursery for seamen--if one national government had not called forth all the national means and materials for forming fleets, their prowess and their thunder would never have been celebrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apply these facts to our own case. Leave America divided into thirteen or, if you please, into three or four independent governments--what armies could they raise and pay--what fleets could they ever hope to have? If one was attacked, would the others fly to its succor, and spend their blood and money in its defense? How, and when, and in what proportion shall aids of men and money be afforded? Who shall command the allied armies, and from which of them shall he receive his orders? Who shall settle the terms of peace, and in case of disputes what umpire shall decide between them and compel acquiescence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whatever may be our situation, whether firmly united under one national government, or split into a number of confederacies, certain it is, that foreign nations will know and view it exactly as it is; and they will act toward us accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they see that our national government is efficient and well administered, our trade prudently regulated, our militia properly organized and disciplined, our resources and finances discreetly managed, our credit re-established, our people free, contented, and united, they will be much more disposed to cultivate our friendship than provoke our resentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, on the other hand, they find us either destitute of an effectual government or split into three or four independent and probably discordant republics or confederacies, what a poor, pitiful figure will America make in their eyes, and how soon would dear-bought experience proclaim that when a people or family so divide, it never fails to be against themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QUEEN ANNE, in her letter of the 1st July, 1706, to the Scotch Parliament, makes some observations on the importance of the UNION then forming between England and Scotland, which merit our attention. I shall present the public with one or two extracts from it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;An entire and perfect union will be the solid foundation of lasting peace; and by this union the whole island, being joined in affection and free from all apprehensions of different interest, will be ENABLED TO RESIST ALL ITS ENEMIES&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We most earnestly recommend to you calmness and unanimity in this great and weighty affair, that the union may be brought to a happy conclusion, being the only EFFECTUAL way to secure our present and future happiness, and disappoint the designs of our and your enemies, who will doubtless, on this occasion, USE THEIR UTMOST ENDEAVORS TO PREVENT OR DELAY THIS UNION&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of Great Britain is the one with which we are in general the best acquainted, and it gives us many useful lessons. Although it seems obvious to common sense that the people of such an island should be but one nation, yet we find that they were for ages divided into three, and that those three were almost constantly embroiled in quarrels and wars with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should the people of America divide themselves into three or four nations, would not the same thing happen? Like most other BORDERING nations, they would always be either involved in disputes and war, or live in the constant apprehension of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The North is generally the region of strength, and many local circumstances render it probable that the most Northern of the proposed confederacies would, at a period not very distant, be unquestionably more formidable than any of the others. No sooner would this become evident than the NORTHERN HIVE would excite the same ideas and sensations in the more southern parts of America which it formerly did in the southern parts of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They who well consider the history of similar divisions and confederacies will find abundant reason to apprehend that those in contemplation would in no other sense be neighbors than as they would be borderers; in short, that they would place us exactly in the situations in which some nations doubtless wish to see us, viz., FORMIDABLE ONLY TO EACH OTHER.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From these considerations it appears that those gentlemen are greatly mistaken who suppose that alliances offensive and defensive might be formed between these confederacies, and would produce that combination and union of wills of arms and of resources, which would be necessary to put and keep them in a formidable state of defense against foreign enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nay, it is far more probable that in America, as in Europe, neighboring nations, acting under the impulse of opposite interests and unfriendly passions, would frequently be found taking different sides. And here let us not forget how much more easy it is to receive foreign fleets into our ports, and foreign armies into our country, than it is to persuade or compel them to depart. How many conquests did the Romans and others make in the characters of allies, and what innovations did they under the same character introduce into the governments of those whom they pretended to protect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let candid men judge, then, whether the division of America into any given number of independent sovereignties would tend to secure us against the hostilities and improper interference of foreign nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE three last numbers of this paper have been dedicated to an enumeration of the dangers to which we should be exposed, in a state of disunion, from the arms and arts of foreign nations. I shall now proceed to delineate dangers of a different and, perhaps, still more alarming kind--those which will in all probability flow from dissensions between the States themselves, and from domestic factions and convulsions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To presume a want of motives for such contests as an argument against their existence, would be to forget that men are ambitious, vindictive, and rapacious. To look for a continuation of harmony between a number of independent, unconnected sovereignties in the same neighborhood, would be to disregard the uniform course of human events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The causes of hostility among nations are innumerable. There are some which have a general and almost constant operation upon the collective bodies of society. Of this description are the love of power or the desire of pre-eminence and dominion--the jealousy of power, or the desire of equality and safety. There are others which have a more circumscribed though equally operative influence within their spheres. Such are the rivalships and competitions of commerce between commercial nations. And there are others, not less numerous than either of the former, which take their origin entirely in private passions; in the attachments, enmities, interests, hopes, and fears of leading individuals in the communities of which they are members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men of this class, whether the favorites of a king or of a people, have in too many instances abused the confidence they possessed; and assuming the pretext of some public motive, have not scrupled to sacrifice the national tranquillity to personal advantage or personal gratification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To multiply examples of the agency of personal considerations in the production of great national events, either foreign or domestic, according to their direction, would be an unnecessary waste of time. Perhaps, however, a reference, tending to illustrate the general principle, may with propriety be made to a case which has lately happened among ourselves. If Shays had not been a DESPERATE DEBTOR, it is much to be doubted whether Massachusetts would have been plunged into a civil war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But notwithstanding the concurring testimony of experience, in this particular, there are still to be found visionary or designing men, who stand ready to advocate the paradox of perpetual peace between the States, though dismembered and alienated from each other. The genius of republics (say they) is pacific; the spirit of commerce has a tendency to soften the manners of men. Commercial republics, like ours, will never be disposed to waste themselves in ruinous contentions with each other. They will be governed by mutual interest, and will cultivate a spirit of mutual amity and concord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it not (we may ask these projectors in politics) the true interest of all nations to cultivate the same benevolent and philosophic spirit? If this be their true interest, have they in fact pursued it? Has it not, on the contrary, invariably been found that momentary passions, and immediate interest, have a more active and imperious control over human conduct than general or remote considerations of policy, utility or justice? Have republics in practice been less addicted to war than monarchies? Are not the former administered by MEN as well as the latter? Are there not aversions, predilections, rivalships, and desires of unjust acquisitions, that affect nations as well as kings? Are not popular assemblies frequently subject to the impulses of rage, resentment, jealousy, avarice, and of other irregular and violent propensities? Has commerce hitherto done anything more than change the objects of war? Let experience, the least fallible guide of human opinions, be appealed to for an answer to these inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sparta, Athens, Rome, and Carthage were all republics; two of them, Athens and Carthage, of the commercial kind. Yet were they as often engaged in wars, offensive and defensive, as the neighboring monarchies of the same times. Sparta was little better than a well-regulated camp; and Rome was never sated of carnage and conquest. Carthage, though a commercial republic, was the aggressor in the very war that ended in her destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venice, in later times, figured more than once in wars of ambition, till Pope Julius II gave a deadly blow to the power and pride of this haughty republic. The provinces of Holland, till they were overwhelmed in debts and taxes, took a leading and conspicuous part in the wars of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the government of Britain the representatives of the people compose one branch of the national legislature. Commerce has been for ages the predominant pursuit of that country. Few nations, nevertheless, have been more frequently engaged in war; and the wars in which that kingdom has been engaged have, in numerous instances, proceeded from the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this summary of what has taken place in other countries, whose situations have borne the nearest resemblance to our own, what reason can we have to confide in those reveries which would seduce us into an expectation of peace and cordiality between the members of the present confederacy, in a state of separation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have we not already seen enough of the fallacy and extravagance of those idle theories which have amused us with promises of an exemption from the imperfections, weaknesses and evils incident to society in every shape? Is it not time to awake from the deceitful dream of a golden age, and to adopt as a practical maxim for the direction of our political conduct that we, as well as the other inhabitants of the globe, are yet remote from the happy empire of perfect wisdom and perfect virtue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the point of extreme depression to which our national dignity and credit have sunk, let the inconveniences felt everywhere from a lax and ill administration of government, let the revolt of a part of the State of North Carolina, the late menacing disturbances in Pennsylvania, and the actual insurrections and rebellions in Massachusetts, declare--!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IT IS sometimes asked, with an air of seeming triumph, what inducements could the States have, if disunited, to make war upon each other? It would be a full answer to this question to say--precisely the same inducements which have, at different times, deluged in blood all the nations in the world. But, unfortunately for us, the question admits of a more particular answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Territorial disputes have at all times been found one of the most fertile sources of hostility among nations. We have a vast tract of unsettled territory within the boundaries of the United States. There still are discordant and undecided claims between several of them, and the dissolution of the Union would lay a foundation for similar claims between them all. At present, a large part of the vacant Western territory is, by cession at least, if not by any anterior right, the common property of the Union. In the wide field of Western territory, therefore, we perceive an ample theatre for hostile pretensions, without any umpire or common judge to interpose between the contending parties. To reason from the past to the future, we shall have good ground to apprehend, that the sword would sometimes be appealed to as the arbiter of their differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competitions of commerce would be another fruitful source of contention. Each State, or separate confederacy, would pursue a system of commercial policy peculiar to itself. This would occasion distinctions, preferences, and exclusions, which would beget discontent. The infractions of these regulations, on one side, the efforts to prevent and repel them, on the other, would naturally lead to outrages, and these to reprisals and wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public debt of the Union would be a further cause of collision between the separate States or confederacies. The apportionment, in the first instance, and the progressive extinguishment afterward, would be alike productive of ill-humor and animosity. How would it be possible to agree upon a rule of apportionment satisfactory to all? There is scarcely any that can be proposed which is entirely free from real objections. These, as usual, would be exaggerated by the adverse interest of the parties. Suppose the difficulties of agreeing upon a rule surmounted, and the apportionment made. Delinquencies, from whatever causes, would be productive of complaints, recriminations, and quarrels. There is, perhaps, nothing more likely to disturb the tranquillity of nations than their being bound to mutual contributions for any common object that does not yield an equal and coincident benefit. For it is an observation, as true as it is trite, that there is nothing men differ so readily about as the payment of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laws in violation of private contracts, as they amount to aggressions on the rights of those States whose citizens are injured by them, may be considered as another probable source of hostility. We have observed the disposition to retaliation excited in Connecticut in consequence of the enormities perpetrated by the Legislature of Rhode Island; and we reasonably infer that, in similar cases, under other circumstances, a war, not of PARCHMENT, but of the sword, would chastise such atrocious breaches of moral obligation and social justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the view exhibited of this part of the subject, this conclusion is to be drawn, America, if not connected at all, or only by the feeble tie of a simple league, offensive and defensive, would, by the operation of such jarring alliances, be gradually entangled in all the pernicious labyrinths of European politics and wars. Divide et impera must be the motto of every nation that either hates or fears us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASSUMING it therefore as an established truth that the several States, in case of disunion, or such combinations of them as might happen to be formed out of the wreck of the general Confederacy, would be subject to those vicissitudes of peace and war, of friendship and enmity, with each other, which have fallen to the lot of all neighboring nations not united under one government, let us enter into a concise detail of some of the consequences that would attend such a situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;War between the States, in the first period of their separate existence, would be accompanied with much greater distresses than it commonly is in those countries where regular military establishments have long obtained. The nations of Europe are encircled with chains of fortified places, which mutually obstruct invasion. The history of war, in that quarter of the globe, is no longer a history of nations subdued and empires overturned, but of towns taken and retaken; of battles that decide nothing; of retreats more beneficial than victories; of much effort and little acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this country the scene would be altogether reversed. The want of fortifications, leaving the frontiers of one state open to another, would facilitate inroads. The populous States would, with little difficulty, overrun their less populous neighbors. Conquests would be as easy to be made as difficult to be retained. War, therefore, would be desultory and predatory. PLUNDER and devastation ever march in the train of irregulars. The calamities of individuals would make the principal figure in the events which would characterize our military exploits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This picture is not too highly wrought; though, I confess, it would not long remain a just one. Safety from external danger is the most powerful director of national conduct. Even the ardent love of liberty will, after a time, give way to its dictates. The violent destruction of life and property incident to war, the continual effort and alarm attendant on a state of continual danger, will compel nations the most attached to liberty to resort for repose and security to institutions which have a tendency to destroy their civil and political rights. To be more safe, they at length become willing to run the risk of being less free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The institutions chiefly alluded to are STANDING ARMIES and the correspondent appendages of military establishments. Standing armies, it is said, are not provided against in the new Constitution; and it is therefore inferred that they may exist under it. Their existence, however, from the very terms of the proposition, is, at most, problematical and uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But standing armies, it may be replied, must inevitably result from a dissolution of the Confederacy. Frequent war and constant apprehension, which require a state of as constant preparation, will infallibly produce them. The weaker States or confederacies would first have recourse to them, to put themselves upon an equality with their more potent neighbors. They would endeavor to supply the inferiority of population and resources by a more regular and effective system of defense, by disciplined troops, and by fortifications. They would, at the same time, be necessitated to strengthen the executive arm of government, in doing which their constitutions would acquire a progressive direction toward monarchy. It is of the nature of war to increase the executive at the expense of the legislative authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, we should, in a little time, see established in every part of this country the same engines of despotism which have been the scourge of the Old World. It may, perhaps, be asked, by way of objection to this, why did not standing armies spring up out of the contentions which so often distracted the ancient republics of Greece? The industrious habits of the people of the present day, absorbed in the pursuits of gain, are incompatible with the condition of a nation of soldiers, which was the true condition of the people of those republics. Modern times, concurring with the habits of nations, have produced an entire revolution in the system of war, and have rendered disciplined armies, distinct from the body of the citizens, the inseparable companions of frequent hostility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a wide difference, also, between military establishments in a country seldom exposed by its situation to internal invasions, and in one which is often subject to them, and always apprehensive of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These armies being, in the first case, rarely, if at all, called into activity for interior defense, the people are in no danger of being broken to military subordination. The laws are not accustomed to relaxations, in favor of military exigencies; the civil state remains in full vigor, neither corrupted, nor confounded with the principles or propensities of the other state. The smallness of the army renders the natural strength of the community an over-match for it; and the citizens, not habituated to look up to the military power for protection, or to submit to its oppressions, neither love nor fear the soldiery; they view them with a spirit of jealous acquiescence in a necessary evil, and stand ready to resist a power which they suppose may be exerted to the prejudice of their rights. The army under such circumstances may usefully aid the magistrate to suppress a small faction, or an occasional mob, or insurrection; but it will be unable to enforce encroachments against the united efforts of the great body of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a country in the predicament last described, the contrary of all this happens. The perpetual menacings of danger oblige the government to be always prepared to repel it; its armies must be numerous enough for instant defense. The continual necessity for their services enhances the importance of the soldier, and proportionably degrades the condition of the citizen. The military state becomes elevated above the civil. The inhabitants of territories, often the theatre of war, are unavoidably subjected to frequent infringements on their rights, which serve to weaken their sense of those rights; and by degrees the people are brought to consider the soldiery not only as their protectors, but as their superiors. The transition from this disposition to that of considering them masters, is neither remote nor difficult; but it is very difficult to prevail upon a people under such impressions, to make a bold or effectual resistance to usurpations supported by the military power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are wise enough to preserve the Union we may for ages enjoy an advantage similar to that of an insulated situation. Europe is at a great distance from us. Her colonies in our vicinity will be likely to continue too much disproportioned in strength to be able to give us any dangerous annoyance. Extensive military establishments cannot, in this position, be necessary to our security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we should be disunited, and the integral parts should either remain separated, or, which is most probable, should be thrown together into two or three confederacies, we should be, in a short course of time, in the predicament of the continental powers of Europe --our liberties would be a prey to the means of defending ourselves against the ambition and jealousy of each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A FIRM Union will be of the utmost moment to the peace and liberty of the States, as a barrier against domestic faction and insurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to read the history of the petty republics of Greece and Italy without feeling sensations of horror and disgust at the rapid succession of revolutions by which they were kept in a state of perpetual vibration between the extremes of tyranny and anarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the disorders that disfigure the annals of those republics the advocates of despotism have drawn arguments, not only against the forms of republican government, but against the very principles of civil liberty. They have decried all free government as inconsistent with the order of society. Happily for mankind, stupendous fabrics reared on the basis of liberty, which have flourished for ages, have, in a few glorious instances, refuted their gloomy sophisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is not to be denied that the portraits they have sketched of republican government were too just copies of the originals from which they were taken. If it had been found impracticable to have devised models of a more perfect structure, the enlightened friends to liberty would have been obliged to abandon the cause of that species of government as indefensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science of politics, however, like most other sciences, has received great improvement. The efficacy of various principles is now well understood, which were either not known at all, or imperfectly known to the ancients. They are means, and powerful means, by which the excellences of republican government may be retained and its imperfections lessened or avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this catalogue of circumstances that tend to the amelioration of popular systems of civil government, I shall venture, however novel it may appear to some, to add one more, on a principle which has been made the foundation of an objection to the new Constitution; I mean the ENLARGEMENT of the ORBIT within which such systems are to revolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opponents of the plan proposed have, with great assiduity, cited and circulated the observations of Montesquieu on the necessity of a contracted territory for a republican government. But they seem not to have been apprised of the sentiments of that great man expressed in another part of his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far are the suggestions of Montesquieu from standing in opposition to a general Union of the States, that he explicitly treats of a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC as the expedient for extending the sphere of popular government, and reconciling the advantages of monarchy with those of republicanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is very probable&quot; (says he) &quot;that mankind would have been obliged at length to live constantly under the government of a single person, had they not contrived a kind of constitution that has all the internal advantages of a republican, together with the external force of a monarchical government. I mean a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is a kind of assemblage of societies that constitute a new one, capable of increasing, by means of new associations, till they arrive to such a degree of power as to be able to provide for the security of the united body&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If a single member should attempt to usurp the supreme authority, he could not be supposed to have an equal authority and credit in all the confederate states. Were he to have too great influence over one, this would alarm the rest. Were he to subdue a part, that which would still remain free might oppose him with forces independent of those which he had usurped and overpower him before he could be settled in his usurpation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Should a popular insurrection happen in one of the confederate states the others are able to quell it. Should abuses creep into one part, they are reformed by those that remain sound. The state may be destroyed on one side, and not on the other; the confederacy may be dissolved, and the confederates preserve their sovereignty.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have thought it proper to quote at length these interesting passages, because they contain a luminous abridgment of the principal arguments in favor of the Union. They have, at the same time, an intimate connection with the more immediate design of this paper; which is, to illustrate the tendency of the Union to repress domestic faction and insurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A distinction, more subtle than accurate, has been raised between a CONFEDERACY and a CONSOLIDATION of the States. The essential characteristic of the first is said to be, the restriction of its authority to the members in their collective capacities, without reaching to the individuals of whom they are composed. It is contended that the national council ought to have no concern with any object of internal administration. An exact equality of suffrage between the members has also been insisted upon as a leading feature of a confederate government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Lycian confederacy, which consisted of twenty-three CITIES or republics, the largest were entitled to THREE votes in the COMMON COUNCIL, those of the middle class to TWO, and the smallest to ONE. The COMMON COUNCIL had the appointment of all the judges and magistrates of the respective CITIES. This was certainly the most, delicate species of interference in their internal administration; for if there be any thing that seems exclusively appropriated to the local jurisdictions, it is the appointment of their own officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Montesquieu, speaking of this association, says: &quot;Were I to give a model of an excellent Confederate Republic, it would be that of Lycia&quot;. Thus we perceive that the distinctions insisted upon were not within the contemplation of this enlightened civilian; and we shall be led to conclude, that they are the novel refinements of an erroneous theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMONG the numerous advantages promised by a well constructed Union, none deserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of faction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction: the one, by removing its causes; the other, by controlling its effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are again two methods of removing the causes of faction: the one, by destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence; the other, by giving to every citizen the same opinions, the same passions, and the same interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could never be more truly said than of the first remedy, that it was worse than the disease. Liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an aliment without which it instantly expires. But it could not be less folly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because it nourishes faction, than it would be to wish the annihilation of air, which is essential to animal life, because it imparts to fire its destructive agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second expedient is as impracticable as the first would be unwise. As long as the reason of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty to exercise it, different opinions will be formed. The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of government. From the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results. The most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inference to which we are brought is, that the CAUSES of faction cannot be removed, and that relief is only to be sought in the means of controlling its EFFECTS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a faction consists of less than a majority, relief is supplied by the republican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its sinister views by regular vote. It may clog the administration, it may convulse the society; but it will be unable to execute and mask its violence under the forms of the Constitution. When a majority is included in a faction, the form of popular government, on the other hand, enables it to sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the public good and the rights of other citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To secure the public good and private rights against the danger of such a faction, and at the same time to preserve the spirit and the form of popular government, is then the great object to which our inquiries are directed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By what means is this object attainable? Evidently by one of two only. Either the existence of the same passion or interest in a majority at the same time must be prevented, or the majority, having such coexistent passion or interest, must be rendered, by their number and local situation, unable to concert and carry into effect schemes of oppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this view of the subject it may be concluded that a pure democracy, by which I mean a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person, can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction. A common passion or interest will, in almost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole; a communication and concert result from the form of government itself; and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party or an obnoxious individual. Hence it is that such democracies have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths. Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species of government, have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same time, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their opinions, and their passions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of representation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises the cure for which we are seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic are: first, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a small number of citizens elected by the rest; secondly, the greater number of citizens, and greater sphere of country, over which the latter may be extended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of the first difference is, on the one hand that the public voice, pronounced by the representatives of the people, will be more consonant to the public good than if pronounced by the people themselves, convened for the purpose. On the other hand, the effect may be inverted. Men of factious tempers, of local prejudices, or of sinister designs, may, by intrigue, by corruption, or by other means, first obtain the suffrages, and then betray the interests, of the people. The question resulting is, whether small or extensive republics are more favorable to the election of proper guardians of the public weal. If the proportion of fit characters be not less in the large than in the small republic, the former will present a greater option, and consequently a greater probability of a fit choice. In the next place, as each representative will be chosen by a greater number of citizens in the large than in the small republic, it will be more difficult for unworthy candidates to practice with success the vicious arts by which elections are too often carried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other point of difference is, the greater number of citizens and extent of territory which may be brought within the compass of republican than of democratic government; and it is this circumstance principally which renders factious combinations less to be dreaded in the former than in the latter. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act in unison with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, it clearly appears, that the same advantage which a republic has over a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by a large over a small republic,--is enjoyed by the Union over the States composing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other States. A religious sect may degenerate into a political faction in a part of the Confederacy; but the variety of sects dispersed over the entire face of it must secure the national councils against any danger from that source. A rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any other improper or wicked project, will be less apt to pervade the whole body of the Union than a particular member of it; in the same proportion as such a malady is more likely to taint a particular county or district, than an entire State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the extent and proper structure of the Union, therefore, we behold a republican remedy for the diseases most incident to republican government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE importance of the Union, in a commercial light, is one of those points which has, in fact, commanded the most general assent of men who have any acquaintance with the subject. This applies as well to our intercourse with foreign countries as with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adventurous spirit, which distinguishes the commercial character of America, has already excited uneasy sensations in several of the maritime powers of Europe. They foresee the dangers that may threaten their American dominions from the neighborhood of States, which have all the dispositions, and would possess all the means, requisite to the creation of a powerful marine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impressions of this kind will naturally indicate the policy of fostering divisions among us, and of depriving us, as far as possible, of an ACTIVE COMMERCE in our own bottoms. If we continue united, we may counteract a policy so unfriendly to our prosperity in a variety of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose, for instance, we had a government in America, capable of excluding Great Britain (with whom we have at present no treaty of commerce) from all our ports; what would be the probable operation of this step upon her politics? Would it not enable us to negotiate, with the fairest prospect of success, for commercial privileges of the most valuable and extensive kind, in the dominions of that kingdom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further resource for influencing the conduct of European nations toward us, in this respect, would arise from the establishment of a federal navy. The continuance of the Union under an efficient government would put it in our power, at a period not very distant, to create a navy which, if it could not vie with those of the great maritime powers, would at least be of respectable weight if thrown into the scale of either of two contending parties. A few ships of the line, sent opportunely to the reinforcement of either side, would often be sufficient to decide the fate of a campaign, on the event of which interests of the greatest magnitude were suspended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if to this consideration we add that of the usefulness of supplies from this country, in the prosecution of military operations, it will readily be perceived that a situation so favorable would enable us to bargain with great advantage for commercial privileges. A price would be set not only upon our friendship, but upon our neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By a steady adherence to the Union we may hope, erelong, to become the arbiter of Europe in America, and to be able to incline the balance of European competitions in this part of the world as our interest may dictate. But in the reverse of this eligible situation, we shall discover that the rivalships of the parts would make them checks upon each other. In a state so insignificant our commerce would be a prey to the wanton intermeddlings of all nations at war with each other; who, having nothing to fear from us, would with little scruple or remorse, supply their wants by depredations on our property as often as it fell in their way. The rights of neutrality will only be respected when they are defended by an adequate power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under a vigorous national government, the natural strength and resources of the country, directed to a common interest, would baffle all the combinations of European jealousy to restrain our growth. This situation would even take away the motive to such combinations, by inducing an impracticability of success. But in a state of disunion, it would be in the power of the maritime nations, availing themselves of our universal impotence, to prescribe the conditions of our political existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They would in all probability combine to embarrass our navigation in such a manner as would in effect destroy it, and confine us to a PASSIVE COMMERCE. We should then be compelled to content ourselves with the first price of our commodities, and to see the profits of our trade snatched from us to enrich our enemies and persecutors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unrestrained intercourse between the States themselves will advance the trade of each by an interchange of their respective productions, not only for the supply of reciprocal wants at home, but for exportation to foreign markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial enterprise will have much greater scope, from the diversity in the productions of different States. The variety, not less than the value, of products for exportation contributes to the activity of foreign commerce. Particular articles may be in great demand at certain periods, and unsalable at others; but if there be a variety of articles, it can scarcely happen that they should all be at one time in the latter predicament. The speculative trader will at once perceive the force of these observations, and will acknowledge that the aggregate balance of the commerce of the United States would bid fair to be much more favorable than that of the thirteen States without union or with partial unions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other points of view in which this subject might be placed, of a striking and animating kind. But they would lead us too far into the regions of futurity, and would involve topics not proper for a newspaper discussion. I shall briefly observe, that our situation invites and our interests prompt us to aim at an ascendant in the system of American affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world may politically, as well as geographically, be divided into four parts, each having a distinct set of interests. Unhappily for the other three, Europe, by her arms and by her negotiations, by force and by fraud, has, in different degrees, extended her dominion over them all. Africa, Asia, and America, have successively felt her domination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The superiority she has long maintained has tempted her to plume herself as the Mistress of the World, and to consider the rest of mankind as created for her benefit. Men admired as profound philosophers have, in direct terms, attributed to her inhabitants a physical superiority, and have gravely asserted that all animals, and with them the human species, degenerate in America--that even dogs cease to bark after having breathed awhile in our atmosphere. Facts have too long supported these arrogant pretensions of the Europeans. It belongs to us to vindicate the honor of the human race, and to teach that assuming brother, moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union will enable us to do it. Disunion will will add another victim to his triumphs. Let Americans disdain to be the instruments of European greatness! Let the thirteen States, bound together in a strict and indissoluble Union, concur in erecting one great American system, superior to the control of all transatlantic force or influence, and able to dictate the terms of the connection between the old and the new world!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE effects of Union upon the commercial prosperity of the States have been sufficiently delineated. Its tendency to promote the interests of revenue will be the subject of our present inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability of a country to pay taxes must always be proportioned, in a great degree, to the quantity of money in circulation, and to the celerity with which it circulates. Commerce, contributing to both these objects, must of necessity render the payment of taxes easier, and facilitate the requisite supplies to the treasury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is not in this aspect of the subject alone that Union will be seen to conduce to the purpose of revenue. There are other points of view, in which its influence will appear more immediate and decisive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is evident from the state of the country, from the habits of the people, from the experience we have had on the point itself, that it is impracticable to raise any very considerable sums by direct taxation. The popular system of administration inherent in the nature of popular government, coinciding with the real scarcity of money incident to a languid and mutilated state of trade, has hitherto defeated every experiment for extensive collections, and has at length taught the different legislatures the folly of attempting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No person acquainted with what happens in other countries will be surprised at this circumstance. In so opulent a nation as that of Britain, where direct taxes from superior wealth must be much more tolerable, and, from the vigor of the government, much more practicable, than in America, far the greatest part of the national revenue is derived from taxes of the indirect kind, from imposts, and from excises. Duties on imported articles form a large branch of this latter description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In America, it is evident that we must a long time depend for the means of revenue chiefly on such duties. In most parts of it, excises must be confined within a narrow compass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these remarks have any foundation, that state of things which will best enable us to improve and extend so valuable a resource must be best adapted to our political welfare. And it cannot admit of a serious doubt, that this state of things must rest on the basis of a general Union. As far as this would be conducive to the interests of commerce, so far it must tend to the extension of the revenue to be drawn from that source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relative situation of these States conspire to render an illicit trade between them a matter of little difficulty, and would insure frequent evasions of the commercial regulations of each other. The separate States or confederacies would be necessitated by mutual jealousy to avoid the temptations to that kind of trade by the lowness of their duties. The temper of our governments, for a long time to come, would not permit those rigorous precautions by which the European nations guard the avenues into their respective countries, as well by land as by water; and which, even there, are found insufficient obstacles to the adventurous stratagems of avarice. The arbitrary and vexatious powers with which the patrols are necessarily armed, would be intolerable in a free country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, on the contrary, there be but one government pervading all the States, there will be, as to the principal part of our commerce, but ONE SIDE to guard--the ATLANTIC COAST. An ordinary degree of vigilance would be competent to the prevention of any material infractions upon the rights of the revenue. A few armed vessels, judiciously stationed at the entrances of our ports, might at a small expense be made useful sentinels of the laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore evident, that one national government would be able, at much less expense, to extend the duties on imports, beyond comparison, further than would be practicable to the States separately, or to any partial confederacies. The single article of ardent spirits, under federal regulation, might be made to furnish a considerable revenue; if it should tend to diminish the consumption of it, such an effect would be equally favorable to the agriculture, to the economy, to the morals, and to the health of the society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will be the consequence, if we are not able to avail ourselves of the resource in question in its full extent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nation cannot long exist without revenues. In this country, if the principal part be not drawn from commerce, it must fall with oppressive weight upon land. And as, on the other hand, the wants of the government can never obtain an adequate supply, unless all the sources of revenue are open to its demands, the finances of the community, under such embarrassments, cannot be put into a situation consistent with its respectability or its security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus we shall not even have the consolations of a full treasury, to atone for the oppression of that valuable class of the citizens who are employed in the cultivation of the soil. But public and private distress will keep pace with each other in gloomy concert; and unite in deploring the infatuation of those counsels which led to disunion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As CONNECTED with the subject of revenue, we may with propriety consider that of economy. The money saved from one object may be usefully applied to another, and there will be so much the less to be drawn from the pockets of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the States are united under one government, there will be but one national civil list to support; if they are divided into several confederacies, there will be as many different national civil lists to be provided for--and each of them, as to the principal departments, coextensive with that which has been proposed by the convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the dimensions of a State attain to a certain magnitude, it requires the same energy of government and the same forms of administration which are requisite in one of much greater extent. This idea admits not of precise demonstration, because there is no rule by which we can measure the momentum of civil power necessary to the government of any given number of individuals; but civil power, properly organized and exerted, is capable of diffusing its force to a very great extent; and can, in a manner, reproduce itself in every part of a great empire by a judicious arrangement of subordinate institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we attend carefully to geographical and commercial considerations, in conjunction with the habits and prejudices of the different States, we shall be led to conclude that in case of disunion they will most naturally league themselves under two governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more Southern States, from various circumstances, may prefer a system which would give unlimited scope to all nations to be the carriers as well as the purchasers of their commodities. Pennsylvania may not choose to confound her interests in a connection so adverse to her policy. As she must at all events be a frontier, she may deem it most consistent with her safety to have her exposed side turned towards the weaker power of the Southern, rather than towards the stronger power of the Northern, Confederacy. This would give her the fairest chance to avoid being the Flanders of America. Whatever may be the determination of Pennsylvania, if the Northern Confederacy includes New Jersey, there is no likelihood of more than one confederacy to the south of that State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing can be more evident than that the thirteen States will be able to support a national government better than one half, or one third, or any number less than the whole. This reflection must have great weight in obviating that objection to the proposed plan, which is founded on the principle of expense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, in addition to the consideration of a plurality of civil lists, we take into view the number of persons who must necessarily be employed to guard the inland communication between the different confederacies against illicit trade, and who in time will infallibly spring up out of the necessities of revenue; and if we also take into view the military establishments which it has been shown would unavoidably result from the jealousies and conflicts of the several nations into which the States would be divided, we shall clearly discover that a separation would be not less injurious to the economy, than to the tranquillity, commerce, revenue, and liberty of every part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WE HAVE seen the necessity of the Union, as our bulwark against foreign danger, as the conservator of peace among ourselves, as the guardian of our commerce and other common interests, as the only substitute for those military establishments which have subverted the liberties of the Old World, and as the proper antidote for the diseases of faction, which have proved fatal to other popular governments, and of which alarming symptoms have been betrayed by our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that remains, within this branch of our inquiries, is to take notice of an objection that may be drawn from the great extent of country which the Union embraces. The adversaries of the new Constitution are availing themselves of the prevailing prejudice with regard to the practicable sphere of republican administration, in order to supply, by imaginary difficulties, the want of those solid objections which they endeavor in vain to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error which limits republican government to a narrow district has been unfolded and refuted in preceding papers. I remark here only that it seems to owe its rise and prevalence chiefly to the confounding of a republic with a democracy, applying to the former reasonings drawn from the nature of the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true distinction between these forms was also adverted to on a former occasion. It is, that in a democracy, the people meet and exercise the government in person; in a republic, they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents. A democracy, consequently, will be confined to a small spot. A republic may be extended over a large region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this accidental source of the error may be added the artifice of some celebrated authors, whose writings have had a great share in forming the modern standard of political opinions. Being subjects either of an absolute or limited monarchy, they have endeavored to heighten the advantages, or palliate the evils of those forms, by placing in comparison the vices and defects of the republican, and by citing as specimens of the latter the turbulent democracies of ancient Greece and modern Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in modern Europe, to which we owe the great principle of representation, no example is seen of a government wholly popular, and founded, at the same time, wholly on that principle. If Europe has the merit of discovering this great mechanical power in government, by the simple agency of which the will of the largest political body may be concentred, and its force directed to any object which the public good requires, America can claim the merit of making the discovery the basis of unmixed and extensive republics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the natural limit of a democracy is that distance from the central point which will just permit the most remote citizens to assemble as often as their public functions demand, and will include no greater number than can join in those functions; so the natural limit of a republic is that distance from the centre which will barely allow the representatives to meet as often as may be necessary for the administration of public affairs. Can it be said that the limits of the United States exceed this distance? In Great Britain, inferior as it may be in size, the representatives of the northern extremity of the island have as far to travel to the national council as will be required of those of the most remote parts of the Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Favorable as this view of the subject may be, some observations remain which will place it in a light still more satisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first place it is to be remembered that the general government is not to be charged with the whole power of making and administering laws. Its jurisdiction is limited to certain enumerated objects, which concern all the members of the republic, but which are not to be attained by the separate provisions of any. The subordinate governments, which can extend their care to all those other subjects which can be separately provided for, will retain their due authority and activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second observation to be made is that the immediate object of the federal Constitution is to secure the union of the thirteen primitive States, which we know to be practicable; and to add to them such other States as may arise in their own bosoms, or in their neighborhoods, which we cannot doubt to be equally practicable. The arrangements that may be necessary for those angles and fractions of our territory must be left to those whom further discoveries and experience will render more equal to the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let it be remarked, in the third place, that the intercourse throughout the Union will be facilitated by new improvements. Roads will everywhere be shortened, and kept in better order. Communication between different parts will be rendered more and more easy by those numerous canals which beneficence finds so little difficult to connect and complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fourth and still more important consideration is, that as almost every State will, on one side or other, be a frontier, and will thus find, in regard to its safety, an inducement to make some sacrifices for the sake of the general protection; so the States which lie at the greatest distance from the heart of the Union, and which, of course, may partake least of the ordinary circulation of its benefits, will derive greater benefit from it in other respects, and thus the proper equilibrium will be maintained throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I submit to you, my fellow-citizens, these considerations, in full confidence that the good sense which has so often marked your decisions will allow them their due weight and effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearken not to the unnatural voice which tells you that the people of America, knit together as they are by so many cords of affection, can no longer be fellow-citizens of one great, respectable, and flourishing empire. Hearken not to the voice which petulantly tells you that the form of government recommended for your adoption is a novelty in the political world; that it has never yet had a place in the theories of the wildest projectors; that it rashly attempts what it is impossible to accomplish. Shut your hearts against the poison which it conveys; the kindred blood which flows in the veins of American citizens, the mingled blood which they have shed in defense of their sacred rights, consecrate their Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it not the glory of the people of America, that, whilst they have paid a decent regard to the opinions of former times and other nations, they have not suffered a blind veneration for antiquity, for custom, or for names, to overrule the suggestions of their own good sense, the knowledge of their own situation, and the lessons of their own experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had no important step been taken by the leaders of the Revolution for which a precedent could not be discovered, the people of the United States might, at this moment, have been laboring under the weight of some of those forms which have crushed the liberties of the rest of mankind. Happily for America, happily, we trust, for the whole human race, they pursued a new and more noble course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They accomplished a revolution which has no parallel in the annals of human society. They reared the fabrics of governments which have no model on the face of the globe. They formed the design of a great Confederacy, which it is incumbent on their successors to improve and perpetuate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If their works betray imperfections, we wonder at the fewness of them. If they erred most in the structure of the Union, this was the work most difficult to be executed; this is the work which has been new modelled by the act of your convention, and it is that act on which you are now to deliberate and to decide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assume there exists a solution of $K$ different chemicals in a chemical reactor. Assume the composition of the solution - the abundances of the chemicals in the reactor - can change over time as a result of chemical reactions occuring in the solution or chemical flows into the reactor. Assume the solution exists in a world allowing for $J$ different chemical reactions, where each reaction occurs at some rate and upon occurrence consumes some combination of the $K$ different chemicals to produce another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If $a_{jk}$ is the number of molecules of chemical $k$ consumed by reaction $j$, $b_{jk}$ is the number of molecules of chemical $k$ produced by reaction $j$, and $q_j$ is the number of times reaction $j$ occurs per unit-time, then the solution's &quot;chemical reaction network&quot; can be represented as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chemical Reaction Network Theory (CRNT) seeks to understand and predict the dynamics of the composition of the solution by studying the constraints imposed by the available chemical reaction network. More specifically, defining the abundance - the number of molecules - of chemical $k$ in the solution at time $t$ as $C_k(t)$, CRNT seeks to connect the time-evolution of the functions $C_k(t)$, $k=1...K$ to the structure of the network defined by the available chemical reactions and the rates at which they occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section will review some of the ideas and formalism of CRNT that are be useful in reintepreting Sraffa's framework as a special case of CRNT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of the available chemical reaction network - defined by the specific forms of the available chemical reactions, the rates at which those reactions occur, and the chemical flow into the reactor - constrains the dynamics of the chemical abundances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a solution is isolated, meaning there are no chemical flows in or out of the reactor, such that the set of available chemical reactions is the only means by which the composition of the solution may change over time, then the rate of change of the abundance of chemical $k$ is given by the sum over all reactions $j=1...J$ of the the product of the difference between the number of molecules of chemical $k$ produced and consumed by reaction $j$ and the number of times reaction $j$ occurs per unit-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$\frac{dC_k(t)}{dt}=q_1(b_{1k}-a_{1k})+q_2(b_{2k}-a_{2k})+\dots+q_J(b_{Jk}-a_{Jk})$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generalizing from the single chemical equation, defining $\vec{C(t)}$ as the $K$x$1$-dimensional vector of chemical abundances, $A$ as the $J$x$K$-dimensional matrix with entries $[A]_{jk}=a_{jk}$, and $B$ as the $J$x$K$-dimensional matrix with entries $[B]_{jk}=b_{jk}$, the rate of change of the abundances of the chemicals in the solution can be written as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$\frac{d\vec{C(t)}}{dt}=(B-A)^T\vec{q}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the superscript $T$ refers to the matrix transpose and $\vec{q}$ is the $J$x$1$-dimensional vector of reaction rates defined in the chemical reaction network. If the solution is not isolated, meaning there are chemical flows in or out of the solution, then the structural constraint takes the form&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$\frac{d\vec{C(t)}}{dt}=(B-A)^T\vec{q} + \vec{f}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $\vec{f}$ is the $Kx1$-dimensional vector of chemical fluxes. The structural constraint imposes inherent limitations on the dynamics of the composition of the solution: in an isolated system it is not possible for the composition to move in a direction not in the span of the vector representing the available reactions, and in a non-isolated system it is not possible for the composition to move in a direction not spanned by the the sum of the vector representing the available reactions and the vector representing the chemical flux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evolution of the composition of the solution over time must obey the structural constraint. That said, there are an infinite number of ways the solution might evolve while still obeying the structural constraint - there is room to define an additional constraint, one which dictates how the composition of the solution will actually evolve within the structure of the available chemical reaction network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the additional constraint can be any vector function which exists in the span of the structural constraint. For a particular example, if the composition of the solution is assumed to be stable, such that the amount of each chemical in the solution is conserved over time, then there exists an evolutionary constraint&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$\frac{d\vec{C(t)}}{dt}=\vec{0}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For another particular example, if the composition of the solution is assumed to have uniform chemical growth, such that for each chemical, in the words of Sraffa, the rate by which the quantity produced exceeds the quantity used up in production is the same, then there exists an evolutionary constraint&lt;/p&gt;
$$\frac{d\vec{C(t)}}{dt}=\pi A^T \vec{q}$$&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which represents a system of $K$ equations where the $k$th equation is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$\frac{dC_k(t)}{dt}=\pi (q_1A_{1k}+q_2A_{2k}+\dots+q_JA_{Jk})$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which implies that $q_1A_{1k}+q_2A_{2k}+\dots+q_JA_{Jk}$ is the amount of chemical $k$ used up in production each unit-time and ($q_1A_{1k}+q_2A_{2k}+\dots+q_JA_{Jk})(1+\pi)$ is the amount of chemical $k$ produced each unit-time for each chemical $k=1...K$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total mass of the chemical reactor system must be conserved, where the chemical reactor system includes the solution in the reactor and all mass sources and sinks that interact with the solution in the reactor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the assumption that the only possible mass sources and sinks are the chemical flow into the solution and the chemical reactions themselves, conservation of mass requires that the change in mass of the solution must equal the change in mass caused by the chemical reactions plus the change of mass caused by the chemical flow into the system. Or, in other words, the change in mass per-unit-time implied by the evolutionary constraint must match the change in mass per-unit-time implied by the structural constraint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$\vec{m} \cdot \left[ \frac{dC_k(t)}{dt}\right ]_{evolutionary} = \vec{m} \cdot \left[ \frac{dC_k(t)}{dt}\right ]_{structural}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $\vec{m}$ is a vector of chemical masses; $m_k$ is the mass of one molecule of chemical $k$. Chemistry tends to work with relative masses. One chemical is defined as having the unit-amount of mass, and the masses of the other chemicals are defined relative to that unit-amount. Traditionally, one molecule of carbon-12 is defined as having the unit-amount of mass, and the masses of the other chemicals are measured relative to the that unit-amount, called a &quot;mole&quot; for short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugging specific structural and evolutionary constraints into this equation leads to a system that can be used to determine the vectors of reaction rates and chemical masses that permit the solution to evolve in the specified way given the specifed structure of the reaction network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if the system is assumed to have an isolated structural constraint and a stable evolutionary constraint, then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$\vec{m} \cdot (B-A)^T\vec{q} = \vec{m} \cdot \vec{0}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$\vec{m} \cdot (B-A)^T\vec{q} = 0$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the assumption that both $\vec{m}$ and $\vec{q}$ are non-negative, this equation will be satisfied if either $(B-A)^T\vec{q}=\vec{0}$ or $(B-A)\vec{m}=\vec{0}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For another example, if the system is assumed to have an isolated structural constraint and a uniform growth evolutionary constraint, then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$\vec{m} \cdot (B-A)^T\vec{q} = \vec{m} \cdot \pi A^T \vec{q}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$\vec{m} \cdot [B-(1+\pi)A]^T\vec{q} = 0$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the same assumption of non-negativity, this equation will be satisfied if either $[B-(1+\pi)A]^T\vec{q}=\vec{0}$ or $[B-(1+\pi)A]\vec{m}=\vec{0}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is generally safe to assume that each chemical has a non-negative mass; and it is usually convenient to assume that each reaction rate is non-negative. If the only solution to the $\vec{q}$ equation involves negative reaction rates, then those reaction rates can be made positive by switching the sets of chemicals which are consumed and produced; a negative reaction rate can be thought of as implying that the reaction must be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In section $1$, Sraffa asks us to consider an extremely simple society which produces just enough to maintain itself. In this society seperate commodities are produced by separate indistries and are exchanged for one another at a market held after the harvest. Every year, 400 quarters of wheat and 20 tons of iron are consumed to produce 400 quarters of wheat and 20 tons of iron through execution of the following methods of production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$280qr. wood + 12t. iron \rightarrow 400qr. wood$$


$$120qr. wood + 8t. iron \rightarrow 20t. iron$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is added by production to the possessions of society; but each commodity, which initially was distributed between the individuals according to their needs, is found at the end of the year to be entirely concentrated in the hands of its producer. In this society, there is a unique set of exchange values which if adopted by the market restores the original distribution of the products and makes it possible for the process to be repeated; such values spring directly from the methods of production. In this particular example, the exchange values required are $10 qr. wheat = 1t. iron$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In section three, generalizing from the specific cases already presented, Sraffa states the general conditions of production which must be satisfied by the commodity exchange values if they are to allow for the restoration of the initial distribution of commodities when adopted by the market. These conditions of production are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$(A_{a}p_a+B_{a}p_{a}+\dots+K_{a}p_{k}) = A p_{a}$$


$$(A_{b}p_a+B_{b}p_{b}+\dots+K_{b}p_{k}) = B p_{b}$$


$$\vdots$$


$$(A_{k}p_a+B_{k}p_{a}+\dots+K_{k}p_{k}) = K p_{k}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which indicates that each of the $K$ commodities &lt;em&gt;'a'&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;'b'&lt;/em&gt;,..., &lt;em&gt;'k'&lt;/em&gt; are produced by a seperate industry; that the quantity of &lt;em&gt;'a'&lt;/em&gt; anually produced is $A$, etc; and that $A_a$, $B_a$,...,$K_a$ are the quantities of &lt;em&gt;'a'&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;'b'&lt;/em&gt;,..., &lt;em&gt;'k'&lt;/em&gt; annually consumed by the industry which produces $A$, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugging the methods of production of the extremely simple society described in section 1 into these conditions of production and simplifying leads to the system of equations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$280p_W + 12p_I = 400p_w \rightarrow 120p_W = 12p_I \rightarrow 10p_W=1p_I$$


$$120p_W + 8p_I = 20p_I \rightarrow 120p_W = 12P_I \rightarrow 10p_W=1p_I$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which implies that the commodity exchange values which if adopted by the market restore the original distribution of products and makes it possible for the process to be repeated must satisfy $10p_W=1p_I$, which matches the solution asserted by Sraffa in section 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In section $4$, Sraffa asks us to consider a society that produces more than the minimum necessary for replacement and thus has a surplus at the end of each harvest which must be distributed. He assumes that the surplus (or profit) must be distributed in proportion to the means of production (or capital) advanced in each industry; and that such a proportion (the rate of profit) cannot be determined before we know the prices of the commodities. Accordingly, he adds the rate of profit (which he asserts must be uniform for all industries) to the methods of production as an unknown which he calls $r$, and the system becomes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$(A_{a}p_a+B_{a}p_{a}+\dots+K_{a}p_{k})(1+r) = A p_{a}$$


$$(A_{b}p_a+B_{b}p_{b}+\dots+K_{b}p_{k})(1+r) = B p_{b}$$


$$\vdots$$


$$(A_{k}p_a+B_{k}p_{a}+\dots+K_{k}p_{k})(1+r) = K p_{k}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This additional distributional assumption is necessary, because, as Sraffa says, without it the system becomes self-contradictory - if you apply the conditions of production defined in $\S 3$, then you find an inconsistant system of equations for the distribution-restoring commodity exchange values. The addition of an additional variable which characterizes the surplus resolves the inconsistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that the additional variable $r$ is added only to the conditions of production, not to the methods of production. That is, Sraffa does not assume that $(1+r)A_a$ units of commodity &lt;em&gt;'a'&lt;/em&gt; are actually used by the industry which produces $A$ units of &lt;em&gt;'a'&lt;/em&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In section $5$, as en example to which we might apply the general price system described above, Sraffa asks us to consider an adjusted version of the two-commodity society considered in section one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$280qr. wood + 12t. iron \rightarrow 575qr. wood$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$120qr. wood + 8t. iron \rightarrow 20t. iron$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This society produces a social surplus of $175qr. wood$ every year. Sraffa then asserts that the exchange-ratio which enables the advances to be replaced and the profits to be distributed to both industries in proportion to their advances is $15qr. wood$ for $1t. iron$ and that the corresponding rate of profits in each industry is 25%. He then does the arithmatic for the iron industry to demonstrate that this exchange-ratio and profit rate satisfy the distributional assertions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate how the price system becomes self-contradictory without the additional distributional assumption, consider the system of equations which results from plugging these methods of production into the conditions of production described in $\S 3$:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$280p_W + 12p_I = 575p_w \rightarrow 295p_W = 12p_I \rightarrow \frac{295}{12}p_W=1p_I$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$120p_W + 8p_I = 20p_I \rightarrow 120p_W = 12P_I \rightarrow 10p_W=1p_I$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no pair of exchange values $p_W$ and $p_I$ which can satisfy both $\frac{295}{12}p_W=1p_I$ and $10p_W=1p_I$ simultaniously. The conditions of production described in section 3 will lead to inconsistency in any system that produces a surplus, so they must be modified when considering societies that produce more than the minimum necessary for replacement. Plugging the methods of production into the modified conditions of production described in section 4 leads to the price system and profit rate asserted by Sraffa in this section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In section 10, Sraffa intriduces an explicit representation of the quantities of labor used by each industry. He calls $L_a, L_b,..., L_k$ the annual quantities of labor respectively employed in the industries producing $A$, $B$,..., $K$; and he defines them as fractions of the total annual labor of society, which he takes as unity, so that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$L_a+ L_b+...+L_k=1$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He concludes the section by defining $w$ as the wage per unit of labor, which like prices will be expressed in terms of the chosen standard. Adding to his distributional assumptions, Sraffa presumes the wage is to be payed after the harvest each year as a share of the national product, meaning that $w$ can take values between $0$ and $1$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sraffa treats these labor quantities as known variables in the same way that he treats the quantities of each commodity annually consumed and produced by each industry as known variables; and he asserts that they actually appear in the methods of production in the same way that those quantities do. That is, using the society introduced in $\S 5$, Sraffa appears to be assuming that the actual methods of production are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$280qr. wood + 12t. iron + L_w UnitsOfLabour \rightarrow 575qr. wood$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$120qr. wood + 8t. iron + L_I UnitsOfLabour \rightarrow 20t. iron$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $L_W$ and $L_I$ are the given quantities of units of labour used by the wood and iron industries, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, Sraffa defines the national income of the society - the commodities which are left over after subtracting from the national product the commodities consumed by the industries to produce it - as the standard in terms of which the wage and commodity prices are expressed. This definition leads to the equation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$[A-(A_a + A_b +...+A_k)]p_a + [B-(B_a + B_b +...+B_k)]p_b +...+[K-(K_a + K_b +...+K_K)]p_k=1$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This equation takes the place of that which results from defining some arbitrary individual commodity as the standard in terms of which the wage and commodity prices are expressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The addition of this equation to the conditions of production forms a system of $k+1$ equations with $k+2$ unknown variables ($k$ prices, the wage $w$, and the rate of profits $r$). The system can therefore move with one degree of freedom; choosing one of the wage or the rate of profits as the free variable, and observing how varying that variable impacts the variation of the prices of commodities, allows one to study how shifting the distribution of the surplus can impacts the prices of commodities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In section 23, Sraffa identifies a complication to the study of distribution-shift induced price movements which results from expressing the prices of commodities in terms of one which is arbitrarily chosen as standard. Specifically, he identifies the fact that it is impossible to tell of any particular price-fluctuation whether it arises from the peculiarities of the commodity which is being measured or from those of the measuring standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reacting to this complication, he suggests that if we could discover some standard commodity which assures that price-fluctuations arise from the peculiarities of the commodity which is being measured, not those of the standard itself, then we could use it in the study of distribution-shift induced price-movements to isolate the price-movements of individual commodities such that they could be studied in a vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In section 24, Sraffa argues that it is unlikely that an individual commodity could be found which possessed even approximately the necessary requisites to be such a standard commodity. He then posits that a mixture of commodities intepreted as a &quot;composite commodity&quot; might possess the necessary requisites; and in particular he suggests that a composite commodity which consists of the same commodities (combined in the same proportions) as does the aggregate of its own means of production would fulfill the requirements to the letter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, Sraffa begins to state the problem of constructing a Standard commodity in general terms. The first step is finding a set of $k$ suitable multipliers - which may be called $q_a, q_b,...,q_k$ - to be applied respectively to the production-equations of commodities &lt;em&gt;'a'&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;'b'&lt;/em&gt;,..., &lt;em&gt;'k'&lt;/em&gt; such that the percentage by which the output of a commodity exceeds the quantity of it entering the aggregate means of production is equal for all commodities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sraffa identifies this percentage as the Standard Ratio, and denotes it as $R$. To represent this first step, he introduces what he refers to as the &quot;q-system&quot; of equations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$(A_{a}q_a+A_{b}q_{a}+\dots+A_{k}q_{k})(1+R) = A q_{a}$$


$$(B_{a}q_a+B_{b}q_{b}+\dots+B_{k}q_{k})(1+R) = B q_{b}$$


$$\vdots$$


$$(K_{a}q_a+K_{b}q_{b}+\dots+K_{k}q_{k})(1+R) = K q_{k}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To complete this system of $k$ equations and $k+1$ ($q_a, q_b,...,q_k$ and $r$) unknowns, Sraffa defines an additional equation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$L_a q_a + L_b q_b + ... + L_k q_k = 1$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sraffa identifies the role of this equation as defining the unit in which the multipliers are expressed in a way that assures the quantity of labor employed in the standard system is the same as that employed in the actual system of $\S 26$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In section 34, Sraffa defines the multipliers which solve the q-system as $q_{a}^{'}, q_{b}^{'},...,q_{k}^{'}$ and asserts that the system described in $\S 11$ can be transformed into a standard system by applying those multipliers to the production equations as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$q_{a}^{'}[(A_{a}p_a+B_{a}p_{a}+\dots+K_{a}p_{k})(1+r) + L_a w] = q_{a}^{'}A p_{a}$$


$$q_{b}^{'}[(A_{b}p_a+B_{b}p_{b}+\dots+K_{b}p_{k})(1+r) + L_b w] = q_{b}^{'}B p_{b}$$


$$\vdots$$


$$q_{k}^{'}[(A_{k}p_a+B_{k}p_{a}+\dots+K_{k}p_{k})(1+r) + L_k w] = q_{k}^{'}K p_{k}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this standard system he derives the Standard national income which he henceforth adopts as the unit of wages and prices in the original system of production. The adoption is represented mathematically by replaceing the unit-defining equation of $\S 12$ with the equation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$[q_{a}^{'}A-(q_{a}^{'}A_a + q_{b}^{'}A_b +...+q_{k}^{'}A_k)]p_a + [q_{b}^{'}B-(q_{a}^{'}B_a + q_{b}^{'}B_b +...+q_{k}^{'}B_k)]p_b +...+[q_{k}^{'}K-(q_{a}^{'}K_a + q_{b}^{'}K_b +...+K_K)]p_k=1$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this equation also represents the composite commodity which possesses the necessary requisites to serve as the Standard commodity described in $\S 23$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In section 50, Sraffa introduces joint production. Joint production implies a system in which each method of production is allowed to produce more than one type of commodity and each type of commodity can be produced by more than one method of production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In transitioning to a consideration of joint production, Sraffa identifies that each method of production is no longer conveniently understood as its own industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In section 51, Sraffa identifies that each production-process is characterized no longer by the commodity which it produces, but by the proportions in which it uses and the proportions in which it produces, the various commodities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, he introduces new notation, distinguishing process by arbitrarily assigned numbers $1,2,...,k$ instead of by their products &lt;em&gt;'a'&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;'b'&lt;/em&gt;,..., &lt;em&gt;'k'&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, $A_1$, $B_1$,...,$K_1$ denotes the quantities of the various goods &lt;em&gt;'a'&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;'b'&lt;/em&gt;,..., &lt;em&gt;'k'&lt;/em&gt; which are used as means of production in the first process, etc. Further, to distinguish the quantities produced by each process from the means of production, Sraffa encloses their suffixes in parenthesis; thus $A_{(1)}$, $B_{(1)}$,...,$K_{(1)}$ denotes the quantities of the various goods &lt;em&gt;'a'&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;'b'&lt;/em&gt;,..., &lt;em&gt;'k'&lt;/em&gt; which are produced the first process, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying this notation, Sraffa then asserts the conditions of production for the general case of joint production as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$(A_{1}p_a+B_{1}p_{a}+\dots+K_{1}p_{k})(1+r) + L_1 w = A_{(1)}p_a+B_{(1)}p_{a}+\dots+K_{(1)}p_{k}$$


$$(A_{2}p_a+B_{2}p_{a}+\dots+K_{2}p_{k})(1+r) + L_2 w = A_{(2)}p_a+B_{(2)}p_{a}+\dots+K_{(2)}p_{k}$$


$$\vdots$$


$$(A_{k}p_a+B_{k}p_{a}+\dots+K_{k}p_{k})(1+r) + L_k w = A_{(k)}p_a+B_{(k)}p_{a}+\dots+K_{(k)}p_{k}$$

&lt;p&gt;In section 52, Sraffa asserts that the standard commodity in the case of joint production can be constructed using the same method as was done in the single-product case; by finding a set of multipliers which, applied to the $k$ production equations, will result in the quantity of each commodity in the aggregate means of production of the system bearing to the quantity of the same commodity in the aggregate product a ratio which is equal for all commodities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In section 53, Sraffa identifies that, when constructing a standard system from a system with joint production, it will frequently happen that some of the $q$ multipliers will be negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In section 56, Sraffa asserts as a consequence of the existence of negative multipliers the impossibility of visualizing the Standard syestem in the case of joint production as a conceivable rearrangement of the actual processes. He asserts that no meaning can be attached to the 'negative industries' which such multipliers entail, and that we must therefore in the case of joint production be content with the system of abstract equations, transformed by  appropriate multipliers, without trying to think of it as having a bodily existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, because the purpose of the Standard system is to construct the Standard commodity, and negative multipliers can be intepreted as implying an incurred debt in the context of the Standard commodity, Sraffa finds that this systemic unphysicality does not contribute negatively to the propriety of using the Standard commodity to express the wage and commodity prices in the physical system the Standard system is constructed from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sraffa's conditions of production for the general case of joint production can be recovered by 1) parameterizing the growth rate of a solution with a uniform-growth evolutionary constraint and an isolated structural constraint as $\pi = \frac{r}{1-w}$ and 2) assuming the mass added to the solution by the $j$th chemical reaction is $L_j$ for $j=1...J$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mass flow constraint requires that either $[B-(1+\pi)A]^T\vec{q}=\vec{0}$ or $[B-(1+\pi)A]\vec{m}=\vec{0}$. Inserting the growth rate parameterization into the mass vector requirement and rearranging leads to the system of equations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$(1+r)A\vec{m}+w(B-A)\vec{m}=B\vec{m}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mass-addition assumption can be represented by the system of equations $(B-A)\vec{m}=\vec{L}$ (If you assume mass is conserved in chemical reactions you have the system $(B-A)\vec{m}=\vec{0}$). Inserting this system of equations into the mass vector requirement results in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$(1+r)A\vec{m}+w\vec{L}=B\vec{m}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intepreting chemical reactions as methods of production and chemical masses as commodity exchange values, this equation is mathematically equivelant to the matrix form of Sraffa's conditions of production for the general case of joint production as presented in $\S 51$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sraffa identifies the vector $\vec{L}$ as the vector of quantities of labor required for each method of production. He assumes that the quantities of labor have their own unit of measurement, and that the quantities directly enter into the methods of production. He then inteprets the parameter $w$ as the exchange-value per unit of labor, such that the term $w\vec{L}$ has units of exchange value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting from the CRNT perspective, these identifications, assumptions, and intepretations are misguided. The vector $\vec{L}$ is the vector of mass-additions, and therefore has units of mass. Analogizing to exchange values, each component of $\vec{L}$ has units of exchange-value, not labor. Further, the the quantities of exchange-value $L_j$ cannot enter into the methods of production - if they were included in the methods of production, then units of exchange value would be found in the entries of the matricies $A$ and $B$, and the system of equations $(B-A)\vec{m}=\vec{L}$ would be condtradictory by dimensional analysis. The parameter $w$ must also be unitless when starting from the CRNT perspective, just like $r$. If it weren't, the conditions of production would be contradictory by dimensional analysis as not all terms would have units of exchange value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rearranging the reaction rate vector requirement of the mass flow constraint leads to the system of equations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$(1+\pi)A^T\vec{q}=B^T\vec{q}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system of equations is mathematically equivelant to the matrix form of Saffa's joint production q-system of $\S 63$, ignoring the difference between his Basic equations and his productive processes. Intepreting the chemical growth rate as the maximum rate of profits and chemical reaction rates as q-multipliers, this equivelance suggests that the act of identifying a standard commodity can be understood as identifying the method of production execution rates that assure uniform commodity growth. Further, solutions involving negative q-multipliers can be understood as requiring a reversal of the negative-multiplier processes in order for a physically permissable solution to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sraffa inteprets the q-system as a non-physical system with no direct relation to the physical system that motivates the conditions of production. From the CRNT perspective, the q-system represents the same physical system that motivates the conditions of production (only half true, ignoring subtlties of standard commodity because time. The systems appear linked by the assumed amount of mass generated by the reactions per unit time, see sections $\S 10+\S 12$, $\S 33+\S 34$). Sraffa's q-multipliers are the reaction rates which permit uniform commodity growth given the specified methods of production; his original system implicitly assumes $\vec{q}=\vec{1}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the notion that distributional assumptions can be incorporated through parameterization of the commodity growth rate, Sraffa's conditions of producuction can easily be extended beyond the basic capitalist + worker society. For example, consider a society which, in addition to the capitalists that profit on their commidity investments and the workers which recieve a portion of the surplus, has a government that taxes the surplus and corrupt government officials that steal from the surplus. If the tax rate and corruption rate are considered to be portions of the surplus in the same sense as wages, then this distributional assumption can be captured by the growth rate parameterization&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$\pi = \frac{r}{1-w-t-c}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $0&amp;lt;=w+t+c&amp;lt;=1$. The eventual Sraffian conditions of production under this parameterization become&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$(1+r)A\vec{p}+(w+t+c)\vec{L}=B\vec{p}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When wages, taxes, and corruption are all 0, the profit rate is at its maximum level, $\pi$. Whenever wages, taxes, or corruption increase, the profit rate decreases. Obviously, with three surplus-proportion parameters, the effect of varying the surplus-proportion parameters on the profit rate and commodity prices becomes difficult to visualize. But, for any combination of them such that two of three are zero - or $n$ of $n+1$, in general, for this form of parameterization - the effect on profits and relative prices of varying the non-zero parameter is identical to that of varying Sraffa's wage. The Standard Commodity will have the same properties in this society as it does in the basic capitalist + worker one, in the PCMC $\S 23$ sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assume there exists a culture of $K$ different commodities in a society. Assume the composition of the culture - the abundances of the commodities in the society - can change over time as a result of production reactions occuring in the society or commodity flows into the society. Assume the culture exists in a world allowing for $J$ different production reactions, where each reaction occurs at some rate and upon occurrence consumes some combination of the $K$ different commodities to produce another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If $a_{jk}$ is the number of units of commodity $k$ consumed by reaction $j$, $b_{jk}$ is the number of units of commodity $k$ produced by reaction $j$, $q_j$ is the number of times reaction $j$ occurs per unit-time, and $c_k$ is the chosen unit of commodity $k$ (tons of, quarters of, UnitsOf, etc), then the society's $j$th method of production - the $j$th &quot;production reaction&quot; - can be represented as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$P_j: \sum_{k=1}^{K} a_{jk}c_k \xrightarrow[]{q_j} \sum_{k=1}^{K} b_{jk}c_k$$

&lt;p&gt;(which is exactly Von Neumann's symbolic representation of the productive process - this is perhaps not surprising, given that he initially studied chemical engineering &lt;a href=&quot;http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/VonNeumann1945.pdf&quot;&gt;http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/VonNeumann1945.pdf&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;p&gt;A typical assumption in CRNT is that reaction rate $j$ takes the form $q_j=r_j\prod_{k}^{K}C_k(t)^{a_{jk}}$ such that the rate at which a reaction occurs depends on the abundance of each required chemical, with higher rates of occurance when the required chemicals are more abundant. This assumption assures that a reaction cannot occur unless all the required chemicals are present in the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This assumption takes the same mathematical form as the generalized Cobb-Douglas production function. Speculation naturally suggests that the basic Cobb-Douglas production function might be interpreted as representing a single-method society with two commodities, labor and capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCMC framework can be thought of as involving an intentionally executed plan, where methods of production are executed at specified rates. In a CRNT setting the reactions occur without any planning or intention, at rates largeley dependent on the composition of the solution. Each reaction rate does include an arbitrary constant ($r_j$ for reaction rate $q_j$), so there is perhaps some room for planning in PRNT; but plans cannot be relied upon as completely determining the rate at which production reactions occur. In actual chemical engineering, the values of the arbitrary constants tend to be determined emperically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in PCMC, Sraffa considers switches in the executed method of production that result from choosing to execute the most profitable method of production as the most profitable method of production changes with variation of the distributional parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In CRNT, there is the idea of biological switches. A biological switch occurs when the dominant chemical reaction changes as a result of the composition of the solution crossing some threshold, triggering some change in the macroscopically occuring biological behavior. This idea might be extended to PRNT to model how the methods of production actually being executed in a society depend on the dynamics of the culture of commodities in the society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In CRNT, deficiency theorums establish existence and uniqueness criteria for stable solutions in chemical reaction networks, based soley on the graph structure of the reaction network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be extended to PRNT to determine whether or not a given production reaction network allows for a stable solution, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this note I introduce a Naive Bayes framework for estimating the competence of an institution in representing the interest of the public for the simple case of an institution which makes binary decisions informed exclusively by independently voting representatives of the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making the assumptions 1) that the competence of a voter in representing the public interest can be approximated by a function of the public approval and disapproval ratings of the voter and 2) that the public approval and disapproval ratings of a voter can be approximated by the public approval and disapproval ratings of the political party of the voter, I then apply Gallup's Party Images polling and CSPAN voting records to the framework to estimate, then plot over time the competence of the chambers of the Congress of the United States in representing the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An institution can be defined as acting in the public interest when making a decision if it makes the decision most likely to be in the public interest given the available evidence. Under that definition, the competence of an institution in representing the public interest over some time period can be approximated by the decimal-percent agreement between the decisions actually made by the institution during that time period and the decisions which were most likely to be in the public interest given the available evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling the decision most likely to be in the public interest given the available evidence the &quot;epistemic decision&quot; as shorthand, by this definition of competence an institution which always made the epistemic decision would have a competence of $1.0$ for the time period and an institution which never made the epistemic decision would have a competence of $0.0$ for the time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the evidence available to inform each institutional decision is an observed voting profile of a body of representatives of the public coupled to an assumption about the competencies of the representatives in representing the public interest, then the competence of an institution over a time period is the agreement between the decisions actually made by the institution during the time period and the decisions most likely to be in the public interest given the observed representative voting profiles and the assumed representative competence profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if I can define a method for determining the epistemic decision given an observed voting profile of a body of representatives of the public and an assumed representative competence profile as evidence, then, by comparing the actual institutional decisions to the epistemic decisions determined by the method, I can estimate the competence of an institution in representing the public interest over a time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, in this section I develop a Naive Bayes method for calculating the probability a decision is in the public interest given an observed voting profile of representatives of the public and an assumed representative competence profile as evidence. For a given choice between decisions, the epistemic decision is then the determined as the decision with the highest probability of being in the public interest as calculated by the method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In developing the method, I will 1) review how Bayes theorem can be applied in a binary setting to estimate the probability a decision is correct given some set of evidence, 2) review how an observed voting profile can be used as evidence when coupled with an assumed voter competence profile, and 3) assume that individual voter competence in representing the public interest might be approximated by observing that public's opinion of the voter through approval polling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume a decision must be made between two options - call them option $1$ and option $-1$. Assume one of the options is &quot;correct&quot; - call it option $X$. Assume the decision is to be informed exclusively by a set of evidence $v$, which implies both options are equally probable prior to considering $v$ (lol).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The respective posterior probabilities of option $1$ and option $-1$ being correct having considered evidence $v$ are then the respective probabilities of observing the evidence $v$ given option $1$ and option $-1$ being correct relative to the total probability of observing the evidence $v$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$P(X=1|v) = \frac{P(v|X=1)}{P(v|X=1) + P(v|X=-1)}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$P(X=-1|v) = \frac{P(v|X=-1)}{P(v|X=1) + P(v|X=-1)}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where $P(v|X=1)$ is the probability of observing the evidence $v$ given the correct option being $1$ and $P(v|X=-1)$ is similarly the probability of observing the evidence $v$ given the correct option being $-1$. In general, the probability option $x$ is the correct option given observed evidence $v$ is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$P(X=x|v) = \frac{P(v|X=x)}{\sum_{x} P(v|X=x)}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the sum is over all possibilities for the correct option: $1$ and $-1$, in this case. The value of $x$ for which $P(X=x|v)$ is maximized is the option most likely to be correct given the available evidence $v$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume a body of N voters is to produce the evidence meant to inform a decision between two options - call them option $1$ and option $-1$. Assume one of the options is correct - call it option $X$. By Bayes theorem, The probability that the $x$th option is correct given an observed voting profile $\vec{v}=[v_1,v_2,...v_N]$ as evidence is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$P(X=x|\vec{v}) = \frac{P(\vec{v}|X=x)}{\sum_{x} P(\vec{v}|X=x)}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision most likely to be correct given the observed voting profile as evidence is the value of $x$ which maximizes this equation. But, the value of $x$ which maximizes this equation cannot be determined without making assumptions about the form of $P(\vec{v}|X=x)$. Making the Naive Bayes assumption that the voters vote independently conditional on the correct decision, the probability of observing a particular voting profile $\vec{v}$ given the correct option being $x$ can be written as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$P(\vec{v}|X=x)=\prod_{i=1}^{N}P(v_i|X=x)$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, though, a further assumption about the form of $P(v_i|X=x)$ is necessary in order to make use of the voting profile as evidence. One such assumption is that, for each of $i=1...N$, $P(v_i|X=x)$ is parameterized by a single variable $p_i$ directly identifiable as the probability voter $i$ makes the correct decision in a binary setting, such that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$P(X=1|v_i=1)=P(X=-1|v_i=-1)=p_i$$


$$P(X=-1|v_i=1)=P(X=-1|v_i=1)=1-p_i$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining the probability voter $i$ makes the corect decision as &lt;a href=&quot;#0&quot;&gt;the competence of voter&lt;/a&gt; $i$, the voter competence profile is then the profile $\vec{p}=[p_1,p_2,...,p_N]$. Under this assumption about the form of $P(v_i|X=x)$, the probability of observing the voting profile $\vec{v}$ given the correct choice being the $x$th option and an assumed voter competence profile $\vec{p}$ is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$P(\vec{v}|X=x,\vec{p})=\prod_{i=1}^{N}p_{i}^{\frac{1+v_ix}{2}}(1-p_{i})^{\frac{1-v_ix}{2}}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the probability that the $x$th option is correct given an observed voting profile and an assumed voter competence profile as evidence becomes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$P(X=x|\vec{v},\vec{p}) = \frac{1}{1+\prod_{i=1}^{N}(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i})^{-xv_i}}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying an observed voting profile and an assumed voter competence profile to this function allows it to be used to calculate the probability option $x$ is correct for all $x$, thereby allowing me to identify the value of x which maximizes this equation - the &lt;a href=&quot;#1&quot;&gt;option most likely to be correct&lt;/a&gt; given an observed voting profile $\vec{v}$ as evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is of course impossible to know the actual competence of a representative in representing the public interest because there is no way of knowing the exact probability that a representative will make the decision that is in the public interest. Consequently, there is no way to construct a representative competence profile $\vec{p}$ that will allow $P(X=x|\vec{v},\vec{p})$ to be identified as the exact, &quot;correct&quot; probability a decision is in the public interest given a voting profile of a body of representatives of the public as evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, it is of course possible to approximate the competence of a representative in representing the public interest by defining the probability a representative will make the decision in the public interest as a function of presumably relevant parameters. Ideally, the form of the function and the intepretation of the parameters should correspond to some anylytical assumptions about the nature of representative competence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I choose to assume that the competence of a representative in representing the interest of a population can be determined by the opinion of the representative held by the population. Because, in this case, the population is the public, I choose to intepret the parameters as corresponding to public opinion of the representative, and to use a function that is able to map public opinion parameters to probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the ideal public opinion parameter would be an aggregation of public opinion polls that ask the question &quot;how much do you trust the representive to make decisions which are in the public interest? Please respond with a number between 0% and 100%, where 0% implies you trust the representative to never make decisions in the public interest and 100% implies you trust the representative to always make decisions in the public interest&quot;. The public opinion parameter could then be defined as the average of the responses to that question $\bar{q}$, and mapped to a probability with the function $p=f(\bar{q})=\bar{q}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a standardized opinion poll asking the public that question for all representatives of the public, the representative competence profile would then take the form&lt;/p&gt;
$$\vec{p}=[p_1, p_2,...,p_N]=[\bar{q_1},\bar{q_2},...,\bar{q_N}]$$&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, opinion polling as a standardized practice is still in its infancy, and this question has not yet been asked of the public as a regular polling item. As a result, the presumably ideal public opinion parameter cannot be used to construct a representative competence profile. Until better opinion polling is available, I will need to rely on whatever opinion parameters I can find that might plausibly correspond to representative competence for a given institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chambers of the United States Congress make institutional decisions by majority rule. Generally, each decision is between taking and not taking an institutional action. For each action considered by a chamber, each representative of the chamber has the opportunity to vote Yea or Nay; if the constitutionally appropriate majority of the representatives votes Yea, then the proposed action is taken; if not, then the proposed action is not taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congressional voting profiles and the resulting institutional decisions are available on CSPAN's website &lt;a href=&quot;#2&quot;&gt;for each roll-call vote&lt;/a&gt; since 1989. This section identifies public opinion parameters that might plausably parameterize representatives competence profiles for each vote, then, by applying the method defined in the previous section, uses the congressional voting profiles to estimate the corresponding epistemic decisions, and compares those epistemic decisions to the institutional decisions actually made by the houses of Congresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, I will 1) go over the particular representative competence parameterization I settled on, 2) use the parameterization to estimate the competencies of both chambers of each of the 102nd through 115th Congress individually, and 3) plot the trend competencies of the chambers themselves over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lieu of having the resources necessary to make a more reasonable decision, and because it has been polled somewhat consistently by Gallup since 1993, I choose to identify approval rating and disapproval rating as the opinion parameters that might plausably parameterize representative competence profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For simplicity, I take the function that maps the chosen opinion parameters to a probability to be the logistic of &lt;a href=&quot;#3&quot;&gt;the difference between approval rating and disapproval rating&lt;/a&gt;. This mapping assures that a representative who is more approved of than disapproved of by the public will be more likely than not to vote in the public interest, and vice versa; and that representative competence increases diminishingly as the difference between representative approval and disapproval increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, opinion polling regarding individual representatives is sparse, tending to happen only when public opinion of the representative is considered electorally relevant. Consequently, I'm forced to assume that the public approval and disapproval ratings of a representative can be approximated by those of the political party of the representative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the public frequently elects representatives based on their party affiliation instead of their representative capacity, and because representatives frequently vote along their party lines instead of according to their responsibilities as representatives, I feel that this assumption is at least heuristically reasonable. This assumption allows me to use the long-running Gallup Party Images poll to estimate the competencies of Democratic and Republican representatives at the time of each congressional vote from 1993 - the first year the poll ran - to the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again for simplicity, in applying these assumptions I choose to base the competency of a representative for a given vote on the Party Images polling completed on the date closest to the date of the vote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$p_D=\frac{1}{1+e^{-(approval_{D,t}-disapproval{D,t})}}$$


$$p_R=\frac{1}{1+e^{-(approval_{R,t}-disapproval{R,t})}}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where $approval_{D,t}$ is the decimal-percent approval rating of the Democratic party as reported on date $t$, the closest date to the vote a poll was completed; $disapproval_{D,t}$ is the decimal-percent disapproval rating of the Democratic party as reported on the same date; and $approval_{R,t}$ and $disapproval_{R,t}$ are similarly the decimal-percent approval and disapproval ratings for the Republican party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, polls concluding on September 15th 2019 reported the Democratic party as having decimal-percent approval and disapproval ratings of .48 and .50, respectively, and the Republican party as having decimal-percent approval and disapproval ratings of .43 and .55. Consequently, for dates of votes closer to September 15th 2019 than to any other date polls concluded, I take the competencies of Democratic and Republican representatives, $p_D$ and $p_R$, to be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$p_D=\frac{1}{1+e^{-(.48-.50)}} = .495$$


$$p_R=\frac{1}{1+e^{-(.43-.55)}} = .470$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure below displays the competencies of Democratic and Republican representatives from 1993 to the present, calculated using the above method. These are the values which I take as representative competencies while producing the agreement plots displayed in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This competence parameter assumption could be improved by fitting a trend line to the poll results then taking the competencies from the exact date on the fit line instead of from the date of the nearest reported poll result. The assumptions could be further improved by conducting and aggregating a number of national polls which asks the approval question for every representative. Preferably the polls would be taken at regular intervals and in accordance with  regular methodology. This would allow representatives to be treated as individuals instead of as homogeneous party members. Of course, if one were to go through all that effort, they might as well ask a more relevant question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vertical position of each blue dot represents the estimated competence of a chamber of a congress in representing the public interest during its tenure; and their horizontal positions are the last date that the congress made an institutional decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each green/red dot represents an action voted on by a chamber of congress; its color indicates whether or not the action was taken, and its vertical position is the estimated probability taking it was in the public interest given the observed voting profiles and assumed representative competence profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By my chosen definition of institutional competence, a perfectly competent institution would have all green dots above $0.5$ vertically and all red dots below $0.5$ vertically, indicating that it always made the decision most likely to be in the public interest given the available evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competencies of the House and the Senate, as so defined, appear have decayed dramatically over the last generation. The decay reflects the transition of our political parties from trustworthy to untrustworthy in the eyes of the public; once the parties crossed the competence threshold of $0.5$, they became more likely to vote against the public interest than for it. Across the threshold, individual representatives are less reliable than a coin flip; a coin with Yea on one side and Nay on the other is more likely to vote in the public interest than a representative of the public. In fact, across the threshold, each vote by a representative for an option becomes evidence against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If both political parties have a representative competence below $0.5$, then unanimous majority decisions are estimated as having an approximately $0\%$ chance of being in the public interest because all the evidence points to the contrary. If, both political parties had a representative competence above $0.5$, though, unanimous majority decisions would be estimated as having an approximately $100\%$ chance of being in the public interest because all the evidence is in its favour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Gallup began to poll party images only in 1993, there is no convenient way for me to compare the trajectories observed here to earlier trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;1&lt;a class=&quot;anchor-link&quot; href=&quot;#1&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p&gt;$x=1$ will be the option most likely to be correct if  $\prod_{i=1}^{N}(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i})^{-xv_i} &amp;lt; 1$, or, applying basic logarithm rules, if $\sum_{i=1}^N v_i w_i &amp;gt; 0$ where $w_i=ln(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i})$. This is recognizable as the weighted majority decision rule with optimal weights. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2526438&quot;&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2526438&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5253-consistency-of-weighted-majority-votes.pdf&quot;&gt;https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5253-consistency-of-weighted-majority-votes.pdf&lt;/a&gt;. For a viewpoint on the idea that conensus-based decisions cannot be separated from evidence-based decisions in clinical decision making, which is analagous to institutional decision making in that the decisions are one-offish and have significant unmeasurable uncertainty, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2739030?resultClick=1&quot;&gt;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2739030?resultClick=1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;2&lt;a class=&quot;anchor-link&quot; href=&quot;#2&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this method excludes non-roll-call votes, which is a major drawback. Why are only roll-call votes recorded again? Seems dumb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

As is, Approval=0.6 and Disapproval=0.4 leads to the same competence as Approval=0.3 and Disapproval=0.1, for example. Perhaps it would factor into a discrimination parameter, to borrow from the language of item response theory. Another improvement would be adding a parameter that forces  Approval=1.0, Disapproval=0.0, Not Sure=0.0 to map to a competence of 1.0; Approval=0.0, Disapproval=1.0, Not Sure=0.0 to map to a competence of 0.0; and Approval=0.0, Disapproval=0.0, Not Sure=1.0 to map to a competence of 0.5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;0&quot;&gt;0&lt;a class=&quot;anchor-link&quot; href=&quot;#0&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are subtle differences between voter competence as defined here and institutional competence as defined above. Voter competence as defined here represents the &quot;actual probability&quot; the voter makes the decision &quot;actually in the public interest&quot;, but institutional competence as defined above represents a &quot;measurement of the probability&quot; the institution makes the decision &quot;most likely to be in the public interest given the voting profile as evidence&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first place there is no gaurantee that the decision &quot;mostly likely to be in the public interest given the voting profile as evidence&quot; will reflect the decision &quot;actually in the public interest&quot;, and in the second place there is no gaurentee that the &quot;measurement&quot; of the probability will reflect the &quot;actual&quot; probability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this note I develop a Markov Counting Processes (MCP) formalism for describing the evolution of the scoring totals and scoring rates of sports teams playing in leagues with discrete-scoring rules, then apply the Poisson distribution to the formalism to derive a formula for the probability a National Hockey League (NHL) team transitions to $v$ scores-for-per-game (SFg) at $n+m$ games from $u$ SFg at $n$ games. Using the last 10 NHL seasons of scoring outcomes taken from Hockeyreference.com as a sample population, I compare Monte Carlo transition probability estimations to the derived MCP transition probability formula for randomly generated parameter sets $(u,v,n,m)$ with a linear regression. The resulting fit parameters with 95% confidence interval were slope, intercept = $0.994±0.071$, $0.032±0.034$, the r-squared value was $.887$, and the residuals were approximately normally distributed with a mean and variance of close to zero. I intepret the fit parameters, degree of correlation, and residual characteristics as implying that that the derived MCP transition probabilities are equal to the NHL data transition probabilities plus noise resulting from limited data and estimations made in the model, suggesting that modeling sports leagues as MCPs is reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probabalistic descriptions of sports leagues are often developed as parts of efforts to inform predictions of the  outcomes of future league matchups. These efforts typically look to past league matchup outcomes and find strength estimates for each team in the league that, under the chosen model’s assumptions, maximize the likelihood of having observed those past league matchup outcomes. Once the most probable team strengths are determined, the probability one team beats another can be estimated using a function of the two team’s strengths, and the estimation can be used to inform a prediction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These team strengths are, at some level, reflections of team scoring rates – the more scores a team earns per game and the less scores a team allows per game, the stronger the team. In the NHL, for example, the amount of points a team earns in a season – which determines the rank of a team compared to the rest of its league - has been shown to strongly correlate with the difference in its $SFg$ and $SAg$. Further, if an $N$ game NHL season is simulated, as $N$ tends to infinity that correlation tends to one (something something different point-earning schemes as different sorting mechanisms blah blah. something something find the reward scheme that most reliably sorts teams by the end of an $N$ game season blah blah). Despite that fact, there seems to have been little theoretical work done to describe the expected evolution of team scoring rates over the course of a season. The question representing the knowledge gap this note aims fill is therefore, “If a team has scoring rate $u$ at $n$ games into its season, what is the probability it will have scoring rate $v$ at $n+m$ games into its season?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section two begins to answer the representative question by introducing a MCP representation of the evolution of sports team scoring outcomes and defining formalism for describing the probability of observing scoring total outcome transitions. Section three extends the formalism to describe the probability of observing scoring rate outcome transitions. Section four specifies the Poisson distribution as an approximation of an NHL scoring total distribution, then presents the Poisson version of the developed formalism. Section five describes the method used to compare the Poisson MCP scoring rate transition probability estimations to observed-NHL-scoring-rate-based transition probability estimations for various parameter sets (u,v,n,m), then discusses the results of the comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A time-domain Counting Process (CP) counts the number of events that occur during a period of time. The count, $C(t)$, defined as the total number of events that have occurred up until time $t$,  is non-decreasing and takes only integer values. The state of the process at time $t$ is $C(t)$, and the state space the process exists in is $C(t)$’s range. Consider, as an example, repeatedly rolling a regular die. The sum of the values of the roll outcomes can be considered a discrete CP: $C(1)$ – the count after the first roll – would be a random draw from $Uniform(1,6)$, the Uniform distribution that can take values between one and six; $C(2)$ would be the sum of two random draws from $Uniform(1,6)$; and $C(t)$ would be the sum of $t$ random draws from $Uniform(1,6)$. The state space the CP exists in would be the set of integers between $1t$ and $6t$, because $1$ and $6$ are the smallest and largest possible outcomes for a single roll, respectively. Because each roll of the die is an independent event, the probability $C(t+1)$ takes some value depends only on $C(t)$, and the die-rolling CP can be described by a Markov Counting Process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many popular sports such as Football, Soccer, Basketball, Baseball, and Hockey, only a positive integer number of scores can be earned in a game. Additionally, the numbers scores earned by the same team in different games are assumed to be the outcomes of independent events. As a result, the sum of the scores a team has earned in a season can be represented by a MCP. Similarly, the sum of the scores a team allows in a season can be represented by its own MCP. Each game between two teams can be compared to rolling two die; one of the results is added to the first team’s scores-for ($SF$) total and the second team’s scores-against ($SA$) total, and the other is added to the first team’s $SA$ total and the second team’s $SF$ total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team $i$, for example, can be said to be in state $S_i^{n}$ at $n$ games into its season, where $S_i^{n}$ = [$S_{i,0}^n$, $S_{i,1}^n$] = [$SF_{i}^n$, $SA_{i}^n$] is the state with components equal to team $i$’s $SF$ and $SA$ totals $𝑛$ games into its season. Playing the $n$th game in its season transitions team $i$ from state $S_{i}^n$  to state $S_{i}^{n+1}$. For an $N$ game season, team $i$ ends its season in state $S_{i}^N$, and the components of that state vector are that team’s end of season $SF$ and $SA$ totals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consecutive state components are related by $S_{i,p}^{n+1} = S_{i,p}^n+X_{i,p}^n$ and state components separated by $m$ games are related by $S_{i,p}^{n+m} = S_{i,p}^n+\sum_{l=n}^{n+m}X_{i,p}^l$, where $X_i^n$ = [ $X_{i,0}^n$,$X_{i,1}^n$] is a pair of random variables representing team $i$’s $n$th pair of MCP increments - the amount of scores it earns and allows in the $n$th game of its season. Therefore, The probability that component $p$ of team $i$’s scoring total transitions from state $u$ at game $n$ to state $v$ at game $n+1$ is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$P(S_{i,p}^{n+1} = v │ S_{i,p}^n = u) = P_{i,uv,p}^{n+1} = P(X_{i,p}^n=v-u)$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $P(X_{i,p}^n=v-u)$ is the probability that team $i$ earns and allows $v-u$ scores in game $n$ for $p=0$ and $p=1$, respectively. The probability that component $p$ of team $i$'s scoring total transition from state $u$ at game $n$ to state $v$ at game $n+m$ is similarly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$P(S_{i,p}^{n+m} = v │ S_{i,p}^n = u) = P_{i,uv,p}^{n+m} = P(\sum_{l=n}^{n+m}X_{i,p}^l = v-u)$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$P_{i,uv,p}^{n+m}$ can be interpreted as the entry in the $u$th row and $v$th column of a transition probability matrix. Over a season the total number of scores earned and allowed by a team can only increase, and hypothetically any positive integer number of scores can be earned, so the matrix with entries $P_{i,uv,p}^{n+m}$ is an infinite dimensional upper triangular matrix with each entry representing a point in $\mathbb{Z}_{+}^2$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of scores a team earns and allows in a game are assumed to be independent random variables, as has been shown to be reasonable. The transition probability matrix representing the probability team $i$'s scorint total moves from state $S_{i}^n = u = [u_0, u_1]$ to state $S_i^{n+m}= v = [v_0, v_1]$ is then the outer product of the scoring total component transition probability matrices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The set of states $[S_{i}^n ∀ n = 0...N]$ is a realization of a MCP and defines team $i$’s scoring total “path”.

&lt;p&gt;The rates-of-change of a team’s $SF$ total and of its $SA$ total are that team’s scores-for-per-game ($SFg$) and scores-against-per-game ($SAg$). The difference between a team’s $SFg$ and $SAg$ can be considered its “strength”, in the sense that the more scores a team earns per-game and the fewer scores a team allows per-game the stronger the team. In the NHL, for example, the amount of points a team earns in a season – which determines the rank of a team compared to the rest of its league - has been shown to strongly correlate with the difference in its SFg and SAg [3]. If an $N$ game NHL season is simulated, as $N$ tends to infinity that correlation tends to one. Something something different point-earning scheme as different sorting mechanisms blah blah. Something something find the point-earning scheme that most reliably sorts teams by the end of a finite length season blah blah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team’s scoring rate, being a ratio of a positive-integer-number of scores and a positive integer number of games, has a domain of $\mathbb{Q}_{+}^2$.  If team $i$ is in total scoring state $S_{i}^n$, then that team’s scoring rate state is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$Sg_{i}^n = \frac{S_{i}^n}{n} = [SFg_{i}^n, SAg_{i}^n]$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consecutive scoring rate state components are related by the same random variable as consecutive total scoring state components&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$Sg_{i,p}^{n+1} = \frac{1}{n+1}[nSg_{i,p}^n+X_{i,p}^n]$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and, similarly, scoring rate components seperated by $m$ games are related by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$Sg_{i,p}^{n+m} = \frac{1}{n+m}[nSg_{i,p}^n+\sum_{l=n}^{n+m}X_{i,p}^l]$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the probability that component $p$ of team $i$'s scoring rate transitions from state $u$ to state $v$ is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$P(Sg_{i,p}^{n+1} = v │ Sg_{i,p}^n = u) = Pg_{i,uv,p}^{n+1} = P(X_{i,p}^n=(n+1)v-nu )$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the probability that component $p$ of team $i$'s scoring rate transition from state $u$ at game $n$ to state $v$ at game $n+m$ is similarly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$P(Sg_{i,p}^{n+m} = v │ Sg_{i,p}^n = u) = Pg_{i,uv,p}^{n+m} = P(\sum_{l=n}^{n+m}X_{i,p}^l = (n+m)v-nu )$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$Pg_{i,uv,p}^{n+m}$ can be interpreted as the entry in the $u$th row and $v$th column of a transition probability matrix. Because scoring rates depend on the same independent random variables as scoring totals, the transition probability matrix representing the probability team $i$'s scoring rate moves from state $Sg_{i}^n = u = [u_0, u_1]$ to state $Sg_i^{n+m}= v = [v_0, v_1]$ is the outer product of the scoring rate component transition probability matrices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since each $Sg_{i,p}^{n+m}$  depends explicitly on $n$, the set of values $[Sg_{i,p}^{n}  ∀ 𝑛 = 0...𝑁]$ is a realization of a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain. As an example of what scoring rate Markov chains look like, figure 2 plots the scoring total paths of each team in the 2016-2017 NHL season, highlighting the Toronto Maple Leafs as a particular example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formalism developed in sections two and three is not sport specific – the transition probabilities can be applied to any sport in which the number of scores earned in a game can be approximated as a draw from some positive-integer-domain probability distribution. To apply the formalism to a specific sport, the probability distribution representing the likelihood that a certain amount of scores are earned in a game for that sport must be inserted into the transition probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scoring in hockey has been shown to be approximately Poisson. That is, the number of goals a team scores and allows in a game can be approximated as random draws from independent Poisson distributions. That is,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$X_{i,p}^n ~ Poisson(\mu_{i,p}^n)$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where μ&lt;em&gt;(i,0)^n and μ&lt;/em&gt;(i,1)^n represent the number of goals team i is expected to score and allow, respectively, in game n. Hockey is not a purely Poisson process, though, as expected scoring is not uniform over every slice of time in a game. Goals are scored at a disproportionately high rate at the ends of periods - especially at the end of the third period – and during odd man situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignoring the NHL’s deviation from a purely Poisson process and dropping the component notation for clarity, the probability team $i$’s total scoring total transitions from state $u$ at game $n$ to state $v$ at game $n+1$ can be written as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$P(X_{i,p}^n=v-u) = \frac{(\mu_{i,p}^n)^{v-u}e^{-\mu_{i,p}^n}}{(v-u)!}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sum of Poisson variables is a Poisson variable with a mean of the sum of the constituent variable means. Consequently, the probability team $i$’s total scoring total transitions from state $u$ at game $n$ to state $v$ at game $n+m$ can be written as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$P(\sum_{l=n}^{n+m}X_{i,p}^l = v-u) = P_{i,uv,p}^{n+m} = \frac{(\sum_{l=n}^{n+m}\mu_{i,p}^l)^{v-u}e^{-\sum_{l=n}^{n+m}\mu_{i,p}^l}}{(v-u)!}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scoring rate transition probabilities depend on the same Poisson random variable as scoring total transition probabilities. Therefore, the probability team i’s scoring rate transitions from state $u$ at game $n$ to state $v$ at game $n+m$ is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$P(\sum_{l=n}^{n+m}X_{i,p}^l = (n+m)v-nu) = Pg_{i,uv,p}^{n+m} = \frac{(\sum_{l=n}^{n+m}\mu_{i,p}^l)^{[(n+m)v-nu]}e^{-\sum_{l=n}^{n+m}\mu_{i,p}^l}}{[(n+m)v-nu]!}$$

&lt;p&gt;Applying these transition probabilities to the formalism defined above lets us answer the question “If an NHL team has scoring rate $u$ at $n$ games into its season, what is the probability it will have scoring rate $v$ at $n+m$ games into its season?&quot; for any set of parameters $(u,v,n,m)$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to determine if the derivied Markov chain transition probability $Pg_{i,uv,p}^{n+m}$ is a reasonable approximation of the probability an NHL team goes from scoring rate $u$ at game $n$ to scoring rate $v$ at game $n+m$, the values of $Pg_{i,uv,p}^{n+m}$ must be compared to transition probabilites estimated using actual NHL scoring outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the derived Markov chain probabilities could be directly compared to Monte-Carlo probabilities calculated using an NHL a scoring rate outcome sample population. For example, the set of $A$ NHL teams that had a scoring rate of $u$ at $n$ games and the subset of $B$ teams that subsequently had a scoring rate of $v$ at $n+m$ games could be counted, and the probability an NHL team reaches state $Sg^{n+m}=v$ given it was in state $Sg^{n}=u$ could then be estimated by $\frac{B}{A}$. The estimated probability could then be directly compared to $Pg_{i,uv,p}^{n+m}$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, for most transitions, there haven’t been enough teams that reached the exact same final state from the exact same initial state for this direct comparison to be meaningful. Instead, I chose to allow a range of potential $u$ and $v$ values and recast the representative question as “If a team has a scoring rate in the range $u \pm \delta$ at $n$ games into its season, what is the probability it will have a scoring rate in the range $v \pm \delta$ at $n+m$ games into its season?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing for a tolerance $\delta$ in $u$ and $v$ results in the following method for estimating transition probabilities with NHL scoring rate outcomes: the set of $A$ NHL teams that had a scoring rate in the range $u \pm \delta$ at $n$ games and the subset of $B$ teams that subsequently had a scoring rate in the range $v \pm \delta$ at $n+m$ games could be counted, and the probability a team reaches a state $Sg^{n+m}=u$ in the range $u \pm \delta$ given it had a state $Sg^{n}=u$ in the range $v \pm \delta$ is then estimated by $\frac{B}{A}$. Define probability estimates made using this method as $NHL(u,v,n,m,\delta)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These estimates made using NHL scoring outcomes can then be directly compared to a tolerance-modified version of the Markov chain transition probabilities, which I define as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$MC(u,v,n,m,\delta) = \frac{\sum_{z}\frac{e^{-n\mu}(n\mu)^{nz}}{(nz)!}\sum_{x=(n+m)v-nz-\delta(n+m)}^{(n+m)v-nz+\delta(n+m)}\frac{e^{-m\mu}(m\mu)^{x}}{x!}}{\sum_{z}\frac{e^{-n\mu}(n\mu)^{nz}}{(nz)!}}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where the domain of $z$ is the set of permissable values of $Sg_{i}^n$ in the range $u \pm \delta$ and $\mu$ is an approximation of the expected amount of scores earned in a game by the average NHL team, taken to be the average $SFg$ over the last 10 NHL seasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in the last 10 NHL seasons there have been $52$ teams that had a $SFg$ in the range $3 \pm .1$ at $41$ games into their season. Of those teams, $19$ subsequently had a GFg in the range $3 \pm .1$ at $82$ games into their season. Therefore, the NHL scoring rate outcome transition probability estimate is $NHL(3,3,41,82,.1)=\frac{19}{52}=.365$, and the Markov chain scoring rate transition probability estimate is $MC(3,3,41,82,.1)=.357$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I repeatedly pseudo-randomly generated 100 parameter sets $\theta = (u,v,n,m,\delta)$, calculated $MC(\theta)$ and $NHL(\theta)$ for each, and ran a linear regression between the two resulting sets of transition probabilities. The fit takes the form&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$MC(\theta) = \alpha NHL(\theta) + \beta + error(mean,variance)$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants and the error term is normally distributed. If $MC(\theta)$ were equal to $NHL(\theta)$ for every parameter set, then the fit parameters would be $[\alpha,\beta]=[1,0]$, the r-squared value would be $1$, and the error distribution would have a mean and variance of zero. Only a finite number of NHL games have been played, $\mu$ is only an approximation, and hockey is not a purely Poisson process, though, so both $MC(\theta)$ and $NHL(\theta)$ are expected to only be approximations of the true probability corresponding to the parameter set θ. As a result, some deviation of the data from the ideal fit parameters, an r-squared value less than 1, and non-zero error variance should be expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average values of the fit parameters were found to be $[\alpha,\beta]=[0.994,.032]$, the average r-squared value was found to be $.887$, and the errors were approximately Normally distributed with a mean of zero and a variance of $.0082$. The parameter results are only point estimates, but the true parameters are in the ranges $0.923≤\alpha ≤1.065$ and $-.6002≤\beta≤0.066$ with $95%$ confidence. These results suggest that $MC(θ)$ is equal to $NHL(θ)$ plus noise resulting from the imperfect approximations made in calculating the two predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;insert figure 3 here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residual analysis of the linear fit suggests that, while the relation between $MC(θ)$ and $NHL(θ)$ is not perfectly linear, the linear fit is a reasonable approximation. The success of the Markov chain equations in modeling NHL data suggests that modeling the NHL as a set of Markov chains with Poisson transition probabilities is reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Define conceiving of some thing as having it in temporary memory. Define knowing some thing as having it in permanent memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume that any time some thing is in temporary memory there is some probability it transitions to permanent memory - that any time some thing is conceived there is some probability it is acquired as knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Define an idea as any thing that can be conceived and acquired as knowledge. Define the set of all ideas as $I$ - all conceivable, knowable things are contained in the set $I$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Define stimulating a thing as prompting the thing to conceive of an idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Define an experience as any thing that can stimulate. Define the set of all experiences as $E$ - all things that can stimulate are contained in the set $E$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Define a living thing as any thing that is prompted by experiences to conceive of and know of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume that, at every moment a thing is living, it is being stimulated by some experience and conceiving some idea seeded by the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume that not every living thing is equally likely to acquire an idea as knowledge once it is conceived. Assume that not every idea is equally likely to be acquired as knowledge upon conception by a living thing. Assume these are independent effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume that a living thing can be assigned a quantity describing how likely it is to acquire a conceived idea as knowledge on average. Assume that every idea can be assigned a quantity describing how likely it is to be acquired as knowledge upon conception by a living thing on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Define the quantity assigned to a living thing as the aptitude of the living thing. Define the quantity assigned to an idea as the difficulty of the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;3&lt;a class=&quot;anchor-link&quot; href=&quot;#3&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume the probability that a living thing acquires an idea as knowledge upon conceiving it depends only on the aptitude of the living thing and the difficulty of the idea. Explicitly, assume the probability a living thing with aptitude $a$ acquires an idea of difficulty $d$ upon conceiving it is given by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$p(a,d)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-(a-d)}}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume that every acquired idea constitutes an amount of knowledge corresponding to the difficulty of the idea. Explicitly, assume that acquiring an idea of difficulty $d$ earns a living thing quanta of knowledge equal to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$q(d)=e^d$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A living thing with aptitude $a$ which, stimulated by experiences, conceives of N ideas of difficulties $\vec{d}=d_1,d_2,...,d_N$ over its lifetime will then be expected to acquire an amount of lifetime knowledge $K$ equal to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$K(a,\vec{d})=\sum_{i=1}^{N}p(a,d_i)q(d_i)=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{e^{d_i}}{1+e^{-(a-d_i)}}$$
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These forms of $p(a,d)$ and $q(d)$ were chosen for simplicity, not because they resemble reality particularly well. The proper form might be an emperical question. The conclusions drawn below are particular to the assumptions made here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;4&lt;a class=&quot;anchor-link&quot; href=&quot;#4&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume that the aptitude of a living thing is a random draw from a probability distribution. Explicitly, assume the aptitude of a living thing is a random draw from a normal distribution with a mean and deviation characterizing the subset of the set of all living things the living thing belongs to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume that the difficulty of an idea is a random draw from a probability distribution. Explicitly, assume the difficulty of an idea is a random draw from a normal distribution with a mean and deviation characterizing the subset of the set of all ideas the idea belongs to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under these definitions and assumptions, the impact of changing the difficulty of available ideas on the accumulation of knowledge by living things, etc, can be easily approximated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;5&lt;a class=&quot;anchor-link&quot; href=&quot;#5&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I consider a population of 100 living things characterized by a $N(X,1)$ aptitude distribution, where each living thing is assumed to conceive the same set of 100 ideas characterized by a $N(Y,1)$ difficulty distribution for $X$,$Y$ in $-1,0,1$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This note explores the effect of varying wealth inequality on expected GDP growth in a simplified economy, under the assumption that consumer behavior is motivated by the local distribution of available consumption opportunities. First, I introduce a theoretical framework for estimating expected GDP growth given a distribution of wealth and a distribution of available consumption opportunities. Second, I apply the framework to explore how expected GDP growth varies with wealth inequality and distribution of opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a simple economy with no taxes or subsidies, composed of M discrete units of wealth distributed among N economic agents. Taking the value-added perspective, the increase of the GDP of the economy over a time period $\delta t$ can be written as the total wealth added through productive processes by the agents during the time period $\delta t$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$\delta GDP=\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_{i}-c_{i}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where $p_{i}$ is the wealth produced by the productive processes completed during $\delta t$ by economic agent $i$ and $c_{i}$ is the wealth consumed by the same agent in the the same processes. Assuming a constant, uniform return on investment $r$ such that  $p_{i} = (1+r)c_{i}$, the growth can be written as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$\delta GDP=\sum_{i=1}^{N} rc_{i}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the product $rc_{i}$ is the surplus value produced by economic agent $i$ during $\delta t$. Consequently the expected $GDP$ growth can be written as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$E[\delta GDP]=r\sum_{i=1}^{N}E[c_{i}]$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the amount of wealth consumed by an economic agent during time period $\delta t$ is a random variable with a probability distribution characterized by the agent's wealth, such that the expected amounts consumed by agents of identical wealth are identical; and that an economic agent can only consume as much wealth as it has, expected GDP growth can be written as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$E[\delta GDP]=r\sum_{w=0}^{M}N(w)\sum_{c=0}^{w} cP(c,w)$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where $N(w)$ is the number of economic agents having wealth $w$, the inner sum is over all possible amounts of wealth an economic agent of wealth $w$ can consume, and $P(c,w)$ is the probability that an economic agent with wealth $w$ will consume amount of wealth $c$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the probability an agent with wealth $w$ consumes an amount $c$ is the number of opportunities to consume amount $c$ relative to the total number of consumption opportunities available to an agent with wealth $w$, $P(c,w)$ can be written as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$P(c,w) = \frac{O(c)}{\sum_{c=0}^{w}O(c)}=\frac{O(c)}{A(w)}$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where $O(c)$ is the number of opportunities to consume amount of wealth $c$, and $A(w)$ is the total number of consumption opportunities available to an economic agent of wealth $w$. The expected GDP growth is then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$$E[\delta GDP]=r\sum_{w=0}^{M}\frac{N(w)}{A(w)}\sum_{c=0}^{w}cO(c)$$
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a wealth distribution $N(w)$ and an opportunity distribution $O(c)$, the expected GDP growth can be easily computed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
