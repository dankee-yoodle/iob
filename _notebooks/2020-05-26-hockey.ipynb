    "In this note I develop a Markov Counting Processes (MCP) formalism for describing the evolution of the scoring totals and scoring rates of sports teams playing in leagues with discrete-scoring rules, then apply the Poisson distribution to the formalism to derive a formula for the probability a National Hockey League (NHL) team transitions to $v$ scores-for-per-game (SFg) at $n+m$ games from $u$ SFg at $n$ games. Using the last 10 NHL seasons of scoring outcomes taken from Hockeyreference.com as a sample population, I compare Monte Carlo transition probability estimations to the derived MCP transition probability formula for randomly generated parameter sets $(u,v,n,m)$ with a linear regression. The resulting fit parameters with 95% confidence interval were slope, intercept = $0.994¬±0.071$, $0.032¬±0.034$, the r-squared value was $.887$, and the residuals were approximately normally distributed with a mean and variance of close to zero. I intepret the fit parameters, degree of correlation, and residual characteristics as implying that that the derived MCP transition probabilities are equal to the NHL data transition probabilities plus noise resulting from limited data and estimations made in the model, suggesting that modeling sports leagues as MCPs is reasonable."

    "Probabalistic descriptions of sports leagues are often developed as parts of efforts to inform predictions of the  outcomes of future league matchups. These efforts typically look to past league matchup outcomes and find strength estimates for each team in the league that, under the chosen model‚Äôs assumptions, maximize the likelihood of having observed those past league matchup outcomes. Once the most probable team strengths are determined, the probability one team beats another can be estimated using a function of the two team‚Äôs strengths, and the estimation can be used to inform a prediction.

Further, if an $N$ game NHL season is simulated, as $N$ tends to infinity that correlation tends to one (something something different point-earning schemes as different sorting mechanisms blah blah. something something find the reward scheme that most reliably sorts teams by the end of an $N$ game season blah blah). Despite that fact, there seems to have been little theoretical work done to describe the expected evolution of team scoring rates over the course of a season.

    "A time-domain Counting Process (CP) counts the number of events that occur during a period of time. The count, $C(t)$, defined as the total number of events that have occurred up until time $t$,  is non-decreasing and takes only integer values. The state of the process at time $t$ is $C(t)$, and the state space the process exists in is $C(t)$‚Äôs range. Consider, as an example, repeatedly rolling a regular die. The sum of the values of the roll outcomes can be considered a discrete CP: $C(1)$ ‚Äì the count after the first roll ‚Äì would be a random draw from $Uniform(1,6)$, the Uniform distribution that can take values between one and six; $C(2)$ would be the sum of two random draws from $Uniform(1,6)$; and $C(t)$ would be the sum of $t$ random draws from $Uniform(1,6)$. The state space the CP exists in would be the set of integers between $1t$ and $6t$, because $1$ and $6$ are the smallest and largest possible outcomes for a single roll, respectively. Because each roll of the die is an independent event, the probability $C(t+1)$ takes some value depends only on $C(t)$, and the die-rolling CP can be described by a Markov Counting Process. "
